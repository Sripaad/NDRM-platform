1237944733906825216 2020-03-12 09:03:19 IST <Michael93105> Clearly, Australia was prepared to test for and deal with a significant medical problem. The US still isn‚Äôt thanks to republicans cutting back in the CDC as well as science & community outreach.

1237944703687045127 2020-03-12 09:03:11 IST <Thinktwicemore> Christy, he is not killing Americans. The virus is killing Americans. This isn't going to be straightened out for quite some time. The virus is in control, not Trump, and it is creating havoc because that's what new diseases do. There are plenty of medical experts say the same.

1237944663694286848 2020-03-12 09:03:02 IST <SilaZofficial> TBH, did we expect anything else? Not even taking about treatment costs if the patient needs to be transferred to ICU. Some states have already lowered/partly eliminated the costs for COVID19 tests, but still, it makes me appreciate our mediocre medical system.

Corona could be 250,000-450,000 by some estimates. It all has to do with how fast it spreads vs. our medical supplies/care capacity.  https://youtu.be/cZFhjMQrVts¬†
1237944639497351168 2020-03-12 09:02:56 IST <raeesahnm> I hate that it took a mass outbreak for people to realise just how fucked up the system is. Authorities are only realising now that no sick leave and understaffed medical centres are a massive issue.

1237944628415991809 2020-03-12 09:02:53 IST <Dear_Margo> I would rather rest and quarantine in my own home then in a hospital. Since they would only be giving me the same fluids and Tylenol I can take at home. Leave the hospital for people who have severe cases that require advanced medical care.
1237944624825741313 2020-03-12 09:02:53 IST <votejenngray> It‚Äôs a novel virus. We would all get exposed to it eventually.   The issue is the medical system. We have to slow the spread and not overwhelm the system so it can deal with all the gravely ill people that need help.
1237944618664087552 2020-03-12 09:02:51 IST <stunder> China built mega hospitals in a week.  American Healthcare is going to wait to see how it will be compensated.  I'm pretty sure moving away from socialized medical is the wrong thing to do.

1237944588406382593 2020-03-12 09:02:44 IST <DarrenKilminst1> There's not a credible source in the medical world suggesting mortality rates of 71%. If this is true half the world's population will be wiped out. What is being used to come up with those figures is statistical nonsense. If it's true the TP panic is sensible.

1237944578470301697 2020-03-12 09:02:42 IST <pschmitz1988> I don‚Äôt blame the NBA because it‚Äôs one of their players. So that team has to be checked and the others they‚Äôve played against lately as well.  So I understand their decision. You can‚Äôt continue a season with 2 teams sidelined through medical. Perhaps maybe 3 teams.
1237944577346211840 2020-03-12 09:02:41 IST <TheFerrariLab> I agree that the number harmed economically will be larger than the number that will die. Many in th US haven‚Äôt got the savings to cover an unexpected medical expense - which is what this is, regardless of the severity of their disease.

1237942852081971201 2020-03-12 08:55:50 IST <askwpgirl> What people aren't getting or failing to get is the large number of people who need medical care. Unlike the flu where people can stay home and suffer through it, the hospitalization rate for this is much higher, thus the fear is with overwhelming medical facilities' capacity.

1237942574079500288 2020-03-12 08:54:44 IST <fridawrites> The death rate could be much higher than 2%, 3%, 4% because case numbers are spiking too quickly and resources are too drained.  We only have 330K available hospital beds and who knows how much supportive equipment. Medical professionals will also get sick.

1237942543947632642 2020-03-12 08:54:36 IST <DANICAxDANALIx> I personally feel it's been super hyped up. It only kills 3% of people infected. So, flu only has a 1% mortality rate, but 3% is still super low. And that doesn't even include the cases where people didn't seek medical intervention. So technically it could be lower than 3%.

1237941997522112513 2020-03-12 08:52:26 IST <AvrahamAdler> It‚Äôs an almost certainty. The point now is to slow the spread so that this magnitude contracts the illness over a 2 year span instead of a 6 month span. The latter will overwhelm our medical system and G-d help us all in that case.
1237941996507082752 2020-03-12 08:52:26 IST <DocCav> And there needs to be clarification here. Insurances companies stated that they are waiving co-pays for the TESTING, not the treatment. You still get to bankrupt your family with medical bills if you manage to get your hands on a test and it comes back positive.

1237941013412491270 2020-03-12 08:48:32 IST <Quanos_> The reason they want people infected to be quarantined is because if he number of people infected overly exceedes a medical facilities ability to treat/test/diagnose the disease, the higher the mortality rate will be.

So sad to see that people's lives are being ruined due to corrupt laws making marijuana illegal. I will pray.

1237935842972200961 2020-03-12 08:27:59 IST <wagsrabbit> Talk to medical professionals and scientists who have spent their lives researching viruses and possible pandemics.  Then report on the findings.

Testing is available and upfront cost ¬£0, ditto for any treatment or hospital stay and number of bankruptcies due to medical bills in UK also zero
