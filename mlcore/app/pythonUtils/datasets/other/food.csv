1237935590345248768 2020-03-12 08:26:59 IST <nikkilynnderosa> Also, I could name multiple programs that serve underprivileged children and their families supplying them with food and necessities to live on a daily basis. If there was a government mandated shut down of all elementary schools, forcing parents to stay home and miss work by law
1237935590294736897 2020-03-12 08:26:59 IST <BirdingTrip> And the fact that no one comes to his "rally" meetings unless the Union tells them to.  Or there is free food.

1237935580828311558 2020-03-12 08:26:56 IST <RLippIII> Just saw a post of a middle aged woman bitching about a server error which they didnt bitch about it being the wrong food but it wasnt the special price they thought they were getting. Pissed off over 5 dollars.

1237935572670451712 2020-03-12 08:26:54 IST <Bourbontruth> I like the idea about buying gift cards although risky. Food delivery dropped at the door better I guess. Getting creative helping staff also important. Perhaps go fund me for servers at your favorite places or pre-tipping? There must be a way.

1237935548045471746 2020-03-12 08:26:49 IST <AmyThunig> I think, if at all possible, people should have food and supplies for at least 14 days in their home - because if suddenly having to be tested/self isolate, you can't exactly go shopping. News out of Italy is grim, I don't want to add to/rely on an already overburdened system
1237935547659796480 2020-03-12 08:26:48 IST <gomoneygoodell> Guess none of you heard about the concession stand worker serving food to fans at the XFL game in Seattle while he had the coronavirus. But go ahead. Play it like a joke.

1237935541238333442 2020-03-12 08:26:47 IST <CeeOh_Deaver> Get 5 friends together.  Go to Costco.  Everyone gets a cart.   Made dash to the food section, clear out ALL THE PEANUTS and fight over the last containers for good measure.  Mad dash to the front of the store to pay and leave.  Mass hysteria and national peanut shortage ensues.

1237935538486706176 2020-03-12 08:26:46 IST <LoriPow73> I'm intentional about being healthy. I get vitamin D via sunshine, get enough vitamin C, I wash my hands, I don't smoke, avoid junk food & toxins, stay home if sick. I breastfed all 3 kids for 2 years each. No one caught a disease from us because we didn't have it to give.
1237935535949299713 2020-03-12 08:26:46 IST <emily_condie> Can we please kill the trend of calling  people who work at food chains “artists”? Trying to look at art jobs online and finding Subway sandwich artist positions isn’t exactly what I’m going for.

They don't even get flu shots, stay home when they're sick, cover their mouths/noses when they cough/sneeze.   Ignorance is the most dangerous contagion.

The NBA season being suspended for example impacts janitorial staff, food vendors, arena hospitality staff, parking attendants, security, cab/Uber/Lyft drivers, etc. This is much more than “I can’t watch basketball anymore.” WAKE UP.
1237935202967707649 2020-03-12 08:25:26 IST <ParentCps> I've been against mass closing schools mainly because I fear kids won't be fed.  @Sarah4Justice makes a good case. But @chipubschools can't deliver cleaning supplies in 4 days to 600 schools. how will food delivery work? Centers are interesting idea if city can pull it off.

1237933587690708992 2020-03-12 08:19:01 IST <RTerriers> Nutritional Yeast can add umami to foods instead of requiring extra salt. 😁 I eat very little salt, can't hardly stand chips & such that's too salty. Don't do sweets often. Honey can be used to sweeten foods vs sugars.

1237933563049279488 2020-03-12 08:18:55 IST <divineangeI> Well I've been having dreams about the end of the world coming asap. I was getting the message that we all should start growing our own food and prepare for something big that's coming. This year felt really off in general but I couldn't put my finger on it until it all connected
1237933562956898304 2020-03-12 08:18:55 IST <NayfePacewell> For me it's not that big of an issue, but for most, among which are those I care for. Are more panicked about going without food for their family, then getting a little sick.  There is no saving on such a low income.
1237933562877403142 2020-03-12 08:18:55 IST <jonnynonames> Nope, I'm going to Fleet Farm...at least they also have guns and ammo in addition to food and toilet paper.
1237933561421926400 2020-03-12 08:18:55 IST <mom_ortho> So you waited too long to prep, or maybe you just realized you need a little more food than you already got. You go to the store and the bean and rice are all gone. Oh no!!!   Guess what's still there. Protein powder. Cliff bars. Pasta and sauce. Pickled vegetables. Go get these.
1237933558267863042 2020-03-12 08:18:54 IST <FMcwatermelon> The more important question is what will we do with all the beans and rice we stocked up on? Oh wait, we will have Mexican food for 2 years.

1237933556032253952 2020-03-12 08:18:54 IST <ICONOCLASTIAE> The food here is *engineered* to make you sick and the “healthcare” is designed to gaslight and/or bankrupt you.   Health insurance shouldn’t even be legal.   You owe lot think it’s normal bc you’re deeply brainwashed.  (That’s actually why my tweets frequently piss you off.)

1237933153278472192 2020-03-12 08:17:18 IST <nherna7> Any plans on working with other aldermen to buy food in bulk to feed constituents (hopefully things don’t get worse) in need no matter their citizenship status? Stay safe

1237933143358873607 2020-03-12 08:17:15 IST <e_terren> I was doing something much more enjoyable than watching Trump on TV tonight. From what I'm seeing on Twitter, I missed quite the show. Yikes.   Now I'm going to go check my supply of soap and canned food.
1237933143224541184 2020-03-12 08:17:15 IST <MarkM65202008> Please stop being a nitpiking tool. thinking it will influence people to vote democrat. We are much smarter than that. Is it racist to say I went out and ate Chinese food when I really had rice, crab rangoons & mai tai's? Or italian food when I had pasta & veal? Idiots

1237933127647059969 2020-03-12 08:17:11 IST <Zeke_Cao> Food delivery drivers too. They are literally risking their health.
1237933124018937857 2020-03-12 08:17:11 IST <panda_navi> Idk why people think toilet paper first. Food is more important. Have people forgotten that you can take a wash cloth, wipe, clean it thoroughly, and reuse it for future wiping? There is no substitute for food for the human body
1237933121670176768 2020-03-12 08:17:10 IST <khinnenkamp> The Grand Solar Minimum will impact food production going forward. Inflation in food prices is the kind of inflation that hits the poor the hardest.

1237933113688219648 2020-03-12 08:17:08 IST <sayitlaura> The problem is... schools are being shut down & having food/healthcare is vital. What if the people that work in those fields fear getting sick too, they also should have the choice to stay home, but then what do we do?
1237933113533059073 2020-03-12 08:17:08 IST <heiditron3000> Cmon into my dog food job, it’s my second to last day and I’m drinking beer while sitting on the cash register like it’s a lounge singer’s piano and screeching along to Karn Evil 9

1237933100509741057 2020-03-12 08:17:05 IST <grlz2grlz> Things will hopefully get better. Use this as motivation. When I feel that way I take walks (Pokémon go) or exercise. Go to the local gas station or walk to get groceries. Things won’t always be great and food won’t always taste awesome but know you’re not alone.
1237933099733876737 2020-03-12 08:17:05 IST <LuvYuNot> My boy showed up at my class with food for me. But, said he felt bad just bringing for me so he bought food for the whole class. How did I get such a sweetheart 💕💕💕

You can't put food on your own table but you can pay for college for others when your kids can't go.

This is not a large chinese/south korean/japanese or even italian demographic (despite the awesome food) so not seen in the data thus far, but I’m guessing the US will show the numbers.

1237932763208171520 2020-03-12 08:15:45 IST <BPredict> You cannot shut down everything-but-grocery-stores. How do things get to the grocery stores? Truck drivers, gas stations, fuel refineries, dock workers, mechanics, and more... just for the deliveries. How about the companies making, packaging, and processing the food?
1237932762847469568 2020-03-12 08:15:44 IST <JWVerret> What US government needs to do now for stimulus is appropriate tens of billions for medical supplies and for delivery contracts with shipping companies to deliver food and goods to people in quarantine.  Also bulk up the internet infrastructure that will be shortly strained.

1237932738709241857 2020-03-12 08:15:39 IST <jeaniceswift1> I know that many kids (especially the younger ones) rely on school for food and daycare, and calling off school may be unwarranted as it's only the beginning of it here in Ann Arbor. But the risks are high, it only takes one kid in a crowded high school hallway to cause chaos.

These are found in all sugary foods, like Jell-o.  Egg protein: Helps make EFFECTIVE vaccine.  Formaldehyde: THIS IS ALREADY IN YOUR BODY.

This prevents contamination of the vaccine.  Aluminum salts: You ingest these when you are drinking tap water, and some bottled waters, and health products.

It is absolutely important to support restaurants (where possible & where personal health needs allow) because food workers need to support themselves and their loved ones. They can’t work remotely.

I can also tell you that there are wonderful educators at schools that make sure kids do not remain hungry.

The Aussie bush is pretty resilient and some areas are growing again which is always good. But some areas are still receiving food drops for native fauna.

If anything food should be on your priority list, but your fruits and veggies and freeze them for future use. Freeze your meats, milk & bread if that’s a big part of your diet.   Grab your non perishable items.
