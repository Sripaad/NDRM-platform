Cold water doesn't kill bacteria and viruses. Hit all of the things you hands touch with spray disinfectant - car door handles, exterior trunk, house door knobs...

But I got caught in a parking lot of a mall as a teen, accidentally took his clothes too to hide my face from security (bc I worked in the mall 😳) so he had to make eye contact with the guard ass naked as we drove off 🤣
1237926104725323781 2020-03-12 07:49:17 IST <rodofdisaster> I’d add that you may want to consider an “air lock”. Clothes worn to work school are shed in a mud room or outer/isolated area and immediate body wash. It’s a little overkill for the typical citizen but your circumstance is different and stakes are high.
