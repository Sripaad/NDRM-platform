Cause the blankets were made before microfibers were invented and no fabric softener cause one didnt dare dream of such luxury growing up in the depression.

These cleaning rituals should be mandatory even after the virus vanishes and things go back to normal! After all we are paying for supposedly good service.

1237902939534102528 2020-03-12 06:17:14 <RadioKate> Yes - the one particularly for managing teams/being a good manager from afar.   On the other - blankets, to go over proper clothes because you’re too tight to put heating on during day, chocolate - stop buying it else you’ll live on it when you realise you forgot lunch break!

1237902236220403712 2020-03-12 06:14:26 <lithedreamer> Probably run you a nice/shower bath, feed both of us some mango sticky rice (off your body); put on some chill music while I give you a massage and a shower of compliments. Then cuddle up together under the blankets and watch something together?

1237894599474950150 2020-03-12 05:44:06 <TheRealWJF4> I am sick and tired of short blankets. If a “blanket” isn’t even 6 feet long then what’s the point? That’s a napkin not a blanket.
1237894408818675713 2020-03-12 05:43:20 <SpiderBeat> “I don’t even know anymore. I’m just gonna go bury myself under my blankets.”

1237893399530704899 2020-03-12 05:39:20 <AtheosMonde> so youve used the example, we shouldnt to prove your point. Also yes some things do work for both men and women, so surely its nuanced depending on the specific point youre making. for example jews amd muslims share history and culture so no blankets but intricate comparisons.
1237893240658866176 2020-03-12 05:38:42 <anthonyconnor18> Dude, bunk beds were the coolest as a child. I remember when I was like 5, I put a bunch of blankets on the ground and then jumped off the top bunk bed pretending to be a wrestler but I ended up hurting myself because there wasn’t enough blankets.
1237893126229856257 2020-03-12 05:38:14 <ViviParish> Absolutely! And drink lots of coffee/tea. And find cozy chairs with cozy blankets to sit in while we read our books and talk about the art.

It continues to blow my mind that, for example, Joel Olsteen's church hasn't shown up with some blankets and shampoo...
1237885217442054144 2020-03-12 05:06:49 <janemarusaik> It is a little bit of a sticker shock with the price, but good quality yarn has lots of hand-processing involved.

1237861865188777984 2020-03-12 03:34:01 <xNorthKorea> Well if it's a slasher film we have to respect it and pay attention. So I guess that's when we cuddle under the blankets and share popcorn together.

1237859724927717376 2020-03-12 03:25:31 <Levy36Mc> Only in Israel do we go too bad with heavy blankets and heaters on Day one, to a light blanket and no heater on Day 2, and finally, a light sheet  and needing a fan blowing on Day 3. 3 days of spring and it's summer already.

Search Google, phone dad-willfixit hotline and we come to the conclusion it must be the pumps gone. Freezing I text my husband annoyed and stressed, cuddling a hot water and wrapped in blankets. Checking my boiler...
1237858389390028803 2020-03-12 03:20:12 <yooty> Now, from what I hear COVID-19 can cause puking or the runs.  So I'm going to order some extra bed sheets and have washed all our spare blankets so that if a bed needs to be changed at night, we're ready.

1237858204584820741 2020-03-12 03:19:28 <kristal100> The trump administration lawyer was in court arguing that our government didn’t have to provide blankets, soap, or toothpaste to these children in detention. It’s a matter of public record so I’m not sure if you don’t know or don’t care but you’re wrong.
"1237858096740880387 2020-03-12 03:19:03 <omizupillar> Giyuu spared him some glances and decided to bend down and cover Sabito with the blankets properly. And then, on top, with his outer robe.

And it'll turn into a 'vs' event, and I just want to cry. Well, cry and wrap Steve and Namor in blankets, give them hot cocoa, and move them to a separate universe.
1237857817324916736 2020-03-12 03:17:56 <deathtosociali1> President Muhammad OlBummer in fact robbed taxpayers of billions of dollars via corporate bailouts and 1.8B laundered through Ukraine.

1237832932305190914 2020-03-12 01:39:03 <KimVanVleet> I just realized that my knitted baby blanket shrunk and disappeared faster than one would expect.  I think I'll ask my mother about this parenting trickery.  I have other blankets over 50 years old but my baby blanket only lasted a couple of years with not a trace to be found.

1237830411176292354 2020-03-12 01:29:02 <TheDollyMartian> I’m documenting old textiles from my grandmother’s trunk like they belonged to the Queen herself. Studying an old quilt, going into research on the different crocheted doilies and table linens, knitted blankets and some old army blankets I think belonged to my uncle.
1237830385758699520 2020-03-12 01:28:56 <Box0fFrogs> I pre-arranged for a 5am drop off at daycare. They had an early bird room where the little ones could bring blankets and stuffies. If that wasn’t available I’d have taken him in his stroller with lots of blankets. Not voting was not an option.

1237821014018527233 2020-03-12 00:51:42 <AlbeeWanKenobi> Parents, please stop letting your diabolical children on planes with their blankets and pillows.  It smells and full of germs.  It's not a sleepover party.
1237820833109889025 2020-03-12 00:50:58 <apple_britters> Thinkin lots about how when I have an anxiety attack at work the only place I can have my panic moment is the bathroom and how much more hygenic and safe it is to be able to panic at home, in the comfort of a pile of blankets and the glow of a laptop screen.
1237820729384632320 2020-03-12 00:50:34 <Vivdoku> I have a blue long pillow, bundle myself in blankets and hug it untill I fall asleep, I don't know what to do with my arms when I sleep so I have to hold something, I also can't sleep on my back at all.

1237820302593118211 2020-03-12 00:48:52 <SamanthaaJoo13> One thing about me, I’m gonna have throw blankets everywhere.
1237819855161774081 2020-03-12 00:47:05 <oroesangue> Desire to take pale hands in his own, to wrap a body colder than his into warm blankets and just pray whoever was listening it'd be enough to keep the weaker body alive. Selfish, that's what he is, for acknowledging the pain Bruno must live every single day, the desperation ー
1237819851621584896 2020-03-12 00:47:04 <Daxxxxy> We were talking about the corona virus is philosophy and discussing what are really the most effective ways to not get it and a Native American girl, no stutter said “Just don’t accept blankets from the government.” LOL  pic.twitter.com/uW382KsAbS

1237819451904413696 2020-03-12 00:45:29 <RonaldBlankets> I get that skepticism. I'm skeptical, too. But I'd rather place my bet on a 10% possibility than a 0% possibility. And then continue to press whoever I can at every level of govt to recognize the need for m4a.

1237817932152885248 2020-03-12 00:39:27 <BurgandySkies> Some of my son's close LGBTQ friends seem to be having a rough time so I started quietly knitting blankets for them. It's going to take me awhile, but his bestie seemed so happy when I gave him his personalized blanket and honestly it's the best feeling.
1237817437955002372 2020-03-12 00:37:29 <byronNME> If you're thinking of creating a communist community organization/local party, think first of material need, not of exclusively aesthetic/ideological concerns.

Not only is it lifted way off the ground, it's stable and you can store things underneath, saving more space in the tent (and god knows you need as much space as possible)! Also, good pillows and MANY blankets. 2x pairs of socks as you'd think.

1237809491514732545 2020-03-12 00:05:54 <blossomandbone> Bed-wise, I'd usually recommend a few layers of rugs and blankets and then the mattress and sleeping bag on top, never directly touching the ground. BUT - you know what's an absolute godsend if you can find a decently-priced one?

1237796738204946433 2020-03-11 23:15:14 <3rd_Doctor> Desperate, dying party. It's quite laughable - been in the job just weeks, for a government that's only been in office a few months and delivers the best budget in generations.  The sad little lefty wank blankets are peeved.

1237796528644927488 2020-03-11 23:14:24 <TaquinJ> Do you own a weighted sleep mask? A friend got me one for secret Santa and it massively improved my ability to sleep. I've also heard weighted blankets are good but I haven't been able to buy one yet.

1237789345978781698 2020-03-11 22:45:51 <HazelandRemy> What we do: we rub one of our blankets or fav toys all over it .... that usually works. Some add catnip if you like that. That is a beautiful toy! But in the end... it takes time. If the human ignores it.. they may like it more. Otherwise, some kitties prefer hard surfaces. - Haz

1237780001262645256 2020-03-11 22:08:43 <porter_jude> North American colonists’ warfare against Native Americans often was horrifyingly brutal. But one method they appear to have used—perhaps just once—shocks even more than all the bloody slaughter: The gifting of blankets and linens contaminated with smallpox.
1237779710412636162 2020-03-11 22:07:34 <Convokid22> I don’t understand people who have multiple kids who say they only do laundry one day a week.  Do you not wash sheets and towels and clothes and blankets and then even more clothes?

1237777559485546497 2020-03-11 21:59:01 <djschambach> Do you realize there is a posture of faith? That posture is NOT hiding under our blankets or locking ourselves indoors. No, God prepared a front-row seat for His people. He takes us down into the face of the battle, BUT certainly not to fight.
1237777271072665601 2020-03-11 21:57:52 <HywoodMartin> Pigs in blankets too, not even messing about.   I forgot the trifle though so it's lemonade lollys for afters.

1237775613651378176 2020-03-11 21:51:17 <JennyGibbons5> My favorite way to treat a cold/flu is to put on flannel pjs, pile a half dozen blankets on the bed, and then tempt every cat in the house to join me. Better than a sweat lodge. Maybe it doesn't cure me, but I swear it shaves days off an illness.
1237775588775116801 2020-03-11 21:51:11 <eliotware> Nice. Now tell us the one where you masturbate to the thought of giving smallpox infected blankets to the caged kids on the border?  pic.twitter.com/C3IMXifmdo

1237774803085508608 2020-03-11 21:48:04 <PsychoDeLarge> Darkness had fallen on the dreary town and as many Grimm tales told, when the sky was covered in its starry blankets, the monsters would come out to play.

1237771074449731585 2020-03-11 21:33:15 <HillCorinthian> Same, I was homeless. Use to sleep in my car and turn up the heat while wrapped in blankets just to stay warm at night. It was either waste a bit of gas or be cold. Shower in men’s locker room in the day, go to class, free lunch in BSU.  Then back to car at night.  https://twitter.com/jennmjack/status/1237494721926303744 …

Joy locked in the past, Heartache guards the future, while a thick nothingness blankets my now.  And still, the clock counts my loneliness...
1237769523836698624 2020-03-11 21:27:05 <bluetastegood> I’ll bring the blankets.

1237765679438163968 2020-03-11 21:11:49 <Zaion_Solaris> None of you are weird for preferring cold sheets. I radiate heat like mad, and I sleep better under weight, so the colder the room (and sheets, blankets etc.) are the more I can lay on me. But none of that matters if the sheets start out warm.

When you’re asleep that’s my time to assert dominance by freezing you out and forcing you to cuddle. It’s some bullshit and I won’t tolerate it. #HandsomeKat

You can use blankets, just make sure they aren't around her face and wear tight fitting tops, instead of loose. I always curled up into a ""c"" shape and had her sleep right next to me"

1237717655261515778 2020-03-11 18:00:59 <1paulmcel> Will you be under the blankets?😀
"1237717373563650053 2020-03-11 17:59:52 <colonelblimp2> It's the new ""smallpox"" blankets."
1237717297277603845 2020-03-11 17:59:34 <Doc_Psych0> You know Children in cages happened on his (Biden's) watch as VP?  You know those pictures of kids sleeping on floors covered in the warming blankets (looks like tin foil) were when he was VP?
1237717208702300161 2020-03-11 17:59:12 <TheEricaB> “But what if...” I mutter to myself as I’m crushed to death by all my weighted blankets
1237717087524716545 2020-03-11 17:58:43 <aclip24> Because it would never work. You can’t control human tendencies. People don’t want porridge and canvas blankets. They want a chance to be indepdent and live better than standardized and empty living.
"1237716969035612160 2020-03-11 17:58:15 <terri_watts13> Get a grip: he's not the candidate. HE'S NOT THE CANDIDATE! Crawling into the back, clutching your Bernie Blankets, not voting for Biden(who happens to BE the candidate), will reel in Trump 2.0. THAT is the doom of us AND the planet. 🎶This ain't no fooling around.""🎶"
1237716940145274880 2020-03-11 17:58:08 <alexthayer21> Yesssssss or it gets lost in the blankets and you just can’t find it at all haha I downloaded an app that works as a remote for my tv too when I’m really over the remote haha
1237716825187770370 2020-03-11 17:57:41 <PromoteMichigan> @craigmelvin @TODAYshow I turn my thermostat at home down to 60° when I go to bed (62° in the dead of winter)...and I live in Michigan! Flannel sheets keep me warm. Oh and I use a fan year round as well. My house temp is 66° to 68° during the day. #Sweatshirts #Blankets #Socks
1237716674201124866 2020-03-11 17:57:05 <lcabbabeh> Was in #TheAsda on Breck before. Nobody stockpiling stuff but there was murder at the cooked meats bit over a Pigs-In-Blankets barm. Normal Wednesday tbf... #Stoic <
1237716524745601028 2020-03-11 17:56:29 <hdbintn> I keep thinking about smallpox blankets given to native Americans intentionally. How must they have felt watching people die from something so virulent and infectious.  Our worries are minor compared to what theirs were.    https://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/lord_jeff.html …

1237715555626483712 2020-03-11 17:52:38 <l_cessna> The military officers involved in the exchange of small pox blankets during the siege of Fort Pitt were...wait for it....BRITISH MILITARY OFFICERS. There was no US military...not at hard concept to figure out
1237715207457292288 2020-03-11 17:51:15 <tristekv> Of him, leaving nothing but an empty shell behind.  Jungkook doesn't like it.  Taehyung's eyes are focused on the dimly lit road, eyes glazed over.  He's surrounded by Jungkook's jacket and blankets, but Jungkook can still see the feeble tremors in his shoulders.
1237715142231670784 2020-03-11 17:51:00 <Yongarasu> He makes Kageyama talk to him then, when he is snuggled into his blankets, after having told him everything that has happened to him in the past week and though his boyfriend always calls him a noisy shit, he entertains him anyway. (And Shouyou revels in it)
1237715119754350594 2020-03-11 17:50:54 <linestothemoon> Shadows like blankets here I am unknown and I intend to remain.

"1237713238109945866 2020-03-11 17:43:26 <l_cessna> I guess reading comprehension is really hard for all you trolls. There was no ""United States"" when this specific example we are discussing occurred: the siege of Fort Pitt, the only documented case of the use of small pox infected blankets as a form of germ warfare."

I want to pass on some advice that a doctor gave me while I had aches & a fever: even though you feel cold, don't wear heavy blankets - they can increase your body temp to dangerous levels. I know this unsolicited but please stay safe.
1237712745719566336 2020-03-11 17:41:28 <GreatTammie> It’s cheaper than smallpox blankets

1237712081585090574 2020-03-11 17:38:50 <LizzieCornish> Nowhere NEAR enough empathy and compassion given to young girls at school, even now.  Every school should have a restroom, with pillows/blankets, hot water bottles, & pain-killers available from school nurse, if needed.  Health & Safety rules probably make this impossible...

1237703592204808192 2020-03-11 17:05:06 <TomBlake1917> Good morning! Hope everyone has a great Wednesday. 😊😊  Might just watch 1917 while my partner is at work. Snuggle up in the blankets and just relax. Sounds good to me.  Need to get more Dean and George pictures to edit. Love doing that when I'm bored.😂  pic.twitter.com/8n7TCSFc5w
1237703010366754817 2020-03-11 17:02:47 <l_cessna> Someone didn't do the required reading..if you followed the thread it was specifically about the use of blankets used by those infected with small pox, not just the spread of disease (which was covered,) so....ACTUALLY, you've added zero to the convo that wasn't already covered

1237702004950085632 2020-03-11 16:58:48 <MandaCollins> Yikes! Glad they were able to fix it. Though boo on the AFib. Caths are a literal pain. Did they not give you those sweet sweet warmed blankets? Tbh those blankets are the best part of procedures.

What a snide comment about a company wanting to do something for them, more than you're offering to do.
1237695666157228032 2020-03-11 16:33:36 <christinafakhry> It's easier for the Lebanese government to impose a lockdown on the entire population than actually ban flights from Iran and other infected countries.

1237637962000748544 2020-03-11 12:44:18 <Broke_ahontus> Alright so, I’m house sitting for one of my usual customers and I heard clicking in the kitchen.

1237634078037299200 2020-03-11 12:28:52 <Shwetangles> The warmth of the summer sun mixed with the nip of the winter air. The promise of new beginnings in the flowers and the goodbye to proverbial security blankets. Spring is disruptive but fleeting in both it's presence and it's instruction.

1237631797938147328 2020-03-11 12:19:49 <Candace_R20> It’s sad when there’s a puppy outside in the freezing cold with no blankets or a house to sleep in and the owners don’t feed it or take care just tell it “shut up” or “you piss and shit all over” and it gets tired from all the crying it does legit breaks my heart💔💔

1237630584450469888 2020-03-11 12:15:00 <maggieehorton> Probably no one will think this is as cute as I think it is, but every night, when Frank cuddles up against me under the blankets, head first, he lets out a contented sigh ... & a little tiny, silent-but-not-terribly-smelly, doggy fart. Every night.

1237627345319559168 2020-03-11 12:02:07 <blxeking> He has to coo just a little at how adorable that is, gently tugging the blankets so they cover Saru comfortably and tucking them in.

1237626783190654978 2020-03-11 11:59:53 <kelmardino> When i’m sitting outside in the early morning drinking my coffee, listening to the birds, watching the sky, the trees, the squirrels, knowing that my beautiful family is still snuggled w/their blankets, some of the most perfects moments in life.
1237626215642488832 2020-03-11 11:57:38 <TheBlueVanguard> He snuggles under his blankets in his sleep, curling up into a small ball because thats how he sleeps usually, even if he has a bigger bed.

1237625414522191873 2020-03-11 11:54:27 <EIReyDeLosReyes> Either way, he's placing her down on one side and pulls the blankets up before laying beside her a top of them. His arms fold behind his head as he stares up at the ceiling, listening to the sounds of the streets around them. Animals, cars. Night life. And Beth beside him.

1237618627416748032 2020-03-11 11:27:29 <DavKat43> Why did CDC staff STAND AROUND wearing hazmat suits, as unprotected &untrained DHHS staff were sent to physically interact with repatriated Americans from Wuhan? Those workers were potentially used as live smallpox blankets, to infect the vulnerable migrants they subsequently met  pic.twitter.com/NTuiujkeLT
1237618538510196736 2020-03-11 11:27:08 <TG_SOCCER33> Attempt to sleep in your bed with no blankets on you . It’s the most uncomfortable thing ever.

1237612159888060416 2020-03-11 11:01:47 <ericaarobinette> I just fought  with my blankets for about two minutes straight trying to figure this shit out
1237612077289574401 2020-03-11 11:01:27 <vangoghinggone1> LIBRA those men are like wet blankets
1237611995530031105 2020-03-11 11:01:08 <Rachel78190048> Is it true that tray tables and toilet floors of planes never get cleaned as per disclosures of flight attendants on you- tube? Maybe there could be some reviews on how shred spaces are cleaned ?What about pillows blankets?
1237611860293087234 2020-03-11 11:00:35 <RhiannonRies> I’ve got two large polystyrene chilly bins, two of those emergency rescue foil blankets & a recycled wool packing blanket I’ll cut down for bedding. I’ll turn the bins upside down & glue lids on, and cut a hole for the entrance - glue the foil blanket to the inside of the bin...

1237609101682561024 2020-03-11 10:49:38 <ThomasAMartin2> The pony is a bad deal—we end up saddled (pun intended) w/vet bills, farrier fees, trainer fees, coaching costs, lessons, ring time, stall rental, transpo costs, tournament fees, paying for horse blankets, halters, bits, reins, saddles, saddle covers, saddle pads, boots....😜
1237609051229278209 2020-03-11 10:49:26 <ButterMyButts> I keep rolling over in this beed and there's no pillows no blankets no dog no cat there and it's just fucking me up on the real.
1237609009336614912 2020-03-11 10:49:16 <dreamover> I hate to break it to you, but most of the photos you probably saw with kids in cages with foil blankets were actually from when Biden was VP.

1237608118722236421 2020-03-11 10:45:43 <lilhoodkitty> Does anybody else’s kid constantly kick off the blankets at night ???? Serious question 🤣🤣
1237607637807595520 2020-03-11 10:43:49 <artsmsh> Would it help if there was a quiet area that was meant as a safe space quiet time area so that a child could calm down alone? Like a big cardboard box with christmas lights and pillows and blankets and some books. Sometimes kids need space.

1237607154992873473 2020-03-11 10:41:54 <Skeletextman> Ok, real question: it's 2020; why do video game characters still sleep in bed on top of the blankets instead of under the blankets like real people? It's not like they can't animate cloth draping over an object, so why can't they do blankets?

1237605990138171392 2020-03-11 10:37:16 <ben_howls> If I were a polling place I would stay open all year round, I would have comfy couches and thick blankets, you could call me when you are lonely, I would remind you that you are beautiful and stronger than people give you credit for, you would vote.

I was sick to my stomach when I found out about the blankets. Seems like our schools only want us to know a small amount of history in order to cover up things like this. 😔

1237605556346449921 2020-03-11 10:35:32 <empathywarrior> When I overheat (say, on a sunny day in the summer in a room without A/C) I get sleepy. And when I get super sleepy  I sometimes think I'm cold, so I curl up in blankets. Then I get so overheated that I get sick, and I feel too sick to move  or even throw the blankets off.

1237584762937544705 2020-03-11 09:12:55 <_tylarskye> listen i shoved two toiletry bags, a pair of shoes, two blankets, a bunch of clothes, and a stuffed animal in a carry on. i had to sit on top of it and force it close. it’s a little bent but it’s fine.

1237584554853928961 2020-03-11 09:12:05 <SonataNo123> I swear Americans and their guns are just like babies and toddlers with pacifiers or security blankets. Just a deadlier replacement.
"1237584414151823360 2020-03-11 09:11:32 <Cool_Hedgie> ""you're so cute""  He let a tiny peck on his lips before zooming up to his room and placing Shadow in bed. This time he didn't get in with him, he just covered the ebony with his blankets.  https://twitter.com/PROJECTSHADOVV/status/1237577502240821250 …"
1237584299676684288 2020-03-11 09:11:04 <____callmeari> My child literally cannot have even a tiny piece of my blanket touching him or HIS blankets.. otherwise it’s a problem. And he’ll only sleep with a specific blanket too 🤣

1237584108533862400 2020-03-11 09:10:19 <SOCIETYSPRINCE> The preparations for sleep have been made for him. He's climbed into his bed, by now. Blankets warm..

1237581289894465536 2020-03-11 08:59:07 <ACreatureFeatur> It doesnt bother me, I've learned to sleep anywhere in my 13 years in the Army, but my wife can't do it. She refuses to switch. What really blows people's mind is when we tell them we use separate blankets.
1237581131047792640 2020-03-11 08:58:29 <hwanglucie> Weirdest thing I have ever done is... I dolled myself with bed sheets and blankets as my outfit, then flaunted them off to my parents and cousins as if I walked for Seoul Fashion Week. Oh, good ol' days!

1237580954207571970 2020-03-11 08:57:47 <xStarDragonsx> It's so weird how they don't sell it, I ask for it all the time in hopes they bring it. Funny enough they do bring baby blankets sometimes, my friend gets them for sewing and gave me a small white one which I haven't used yet xD

1237573921068605443 2020-03-11 08:29:50 <Cheryl1572> They are going to do it anyway. I hope Bloomberg blankets the waves with ads about the Trump children when they do. If we do M4A and GND, why did we vote for Biden? Bernie would still be Bernie and quit the party and try to destroy it. That's what he does.

He could get stiff/painful muscles the next morning or worse, catch a cold due to a lack of blankets!  He watched silently as Star +

1237559774780088325 2020-03-11 07:33:37 <erosemac> I get made fun of a lot for being little but the fact of the matter is I can nap under much smaller throw blankets than you tall folk and I consider that a win

1237559589941309440 2020-03-11 07:32:53 <ASloviak> Oh! Ok..! [She awkwardly shuffled off to her room, closing the door and piling her blankets and pillows on the bed before changing into a tank top and shorts, being covered by a cute calico cat kigurumi. She gathered the items and carried them out to the living room.] Here..!
1237559407916896256 2020-03-11 07:32:10 <middlegracie> Yep. I bandage it up every day for school and night for sleeping. If it’s not covered, his blankets touch the raw skin and it’s painful.

1237557184277299200 2020-03-11 07:23:20 <CheatedOnMyEx> Hand woven blankets. They should’ve sold themselves since they were so “fancy”. Let us parlay with the people
1237556528141365253 2020-03-11 07:20:43 <kowyatt> Am in the nerdiest @UNCMPA alumni text string debating the merits of weighted blankets. Can’t say enough about these wonderful people I was lucky enough to go to MPA school with, and now get really old, really fast with. @kwyatt23 @NCRunner2013 @marcbnelson @deborahgoldberg
1237556447518416901 2020-03-11 07:20:24 <gIossranda> bt21 merch! they have lots of cute things like accessories and stationary. you can also try redbubble/society6, you can customize fanart content into things like mugs/blankets/notebooks

1237556127182622721 2020-03-11 07:19:08 <MujerIndigena11> Well, do thoughts and prayers count? What about paper towels? Should we quarantine them in cages with space blankets? 🤔
1237555951919460357 2020-03-11 07:18:26 <RonaldBlankets> Well, I doubt I'll convince you to. I hope you will at least vote in down ballot races. Good luck to you.

1237555311415681024 2020-03-11 07:15:53 <DARKMAG1CK> You’re so right. I’ll never miss sleeping on poorly made cots or on the dirt. I like the lush things. My bed is full of the softest blankets.  [Icarus hums a little, reaching you to squish Johnny’s cheeks.]  Can you stop that?
1237555283582279681 2020-03-11 07:15:46 <ALLIEDWAKANDA> A welcome addition, at that.  He’s always got a fond spot for soft blankets.

1237554270234263556 2020-03-11 07:11:45 <LizardsAreEpic> We could crack open some cold drinks get some snacks and comfy blankets
1237554254602072064 2020-03-11 07:11:41 <RemsenBarbara> Hi Abby! Stay cozy under the blankets and have a good night.😊🤗🌌💤💤💤🐱💛
1237554205587410944 2020-03-11 07:11:29 <RonaldBlankets> Not an answer. Bernie's my choice but Biden can absolutely defeat Trump. There was a lot of Hillary hate that Biden doesn't carry. We have 8 months.
1237554190022397954 2020-03-11 07:11:26 <bobbieanneee> Owen has me tuck him in with at 6 different blankets each night and then I have to sneak back in after he’s sleeping to take them all off lol
1237553937319735297 2020-03-11 07:10:25 <mrsWaif> Or just building a fort with blankets and pillows works just as well. Forts are the best!
1237553582599069703 2020-03-11 07:09:01 <hithahspam> Chores are done. There's no baseball tonight. (The nerve!) So it's time for knitting with Marvel.  You think if I expose these blankets to enough Marvel content while they're being knit, the twins will grow up to be Marvel fans by osmosis?
1237553102728744960 2020-03-11 07:07:06 <gnelsonII> What the heck is with weighted blankets?  Seen it a few times but not familiar with whatever benefits come from I'm guessing a heavy blanket?  I thought comforters were already weighted blankets?  =)
1237553016296722433 2020-03-11 07:06:46 <larry664> can not let them wet blankets ruin the fun for you
1237552984063528960 2020-03-11 07:06:38 <komoBMS> Wrap yourself in some blankets and get cozy and watch some cool videos thats what im doing
1237552767452905473 2020-03-11 07:05:47 <AwkwardForm> OAO rosie??  But mood when I stay under the thick blankets even when it's getting hard to breathe 👀💦
1237552763581509632 2020-03-11 07:05:46 <RonaldBlankets> According to what data?
1237552701774290944 2020-03-11 07:05:31 <TrashTheater1> *Politely begins to disagree with a post on twitter* ...hm... *checks their # of followers* *IMMEDIATELY deletes comment, hides feed, ducks under blankets.*
1237552618559299584 2020-03-11 07:05:11 <chlo_rod1> & warm fuzzy blankets 😣
1237552574552662017 2020-03-11 07:05:01 <PrettyBonesFran> Yeah, the crowd did enjoy it at least. I think I'm biased because of the side I was on. Would've rather been out there with them than pushing those blankets tbh.
1237552449084215298 2020-03-11 07:04:31 <RonaldBlankets> Biden has as much of a chance as Sanders. Calm down.
1237552363969196033 2020-03-11 07:04:10 <ohfortheloveof4> Bad depression day, some crying and passive ideation. But I’m drinking warm tea and will have fresh blankets on my bed tonight, and that’s very comforting.
1237551807875780615 2020-03-11 07:01:58 <RonaldBlankets> Give it a few months
1237551802142187522 2020-03-11 07:01:56 <KBrews_Clues> I pin blankets over all the mirrors and wear sweatpants with no underwear
1237551782215028738 2020-03-11 07:01:52 <CheatedOnMyEx> The management was a jerk and their 200$ blankets weren’t selling well but they brought a valid crowd and they had the stadium rocking
1237551634323877891 2020-03-11 07:01:16 <ChristineeGaul> so you can also change your clothes after getting home after going out, washing sheets/blankets, and disinfecting your phone/surfaces that are used regularly to prevent spread
1237551416836677632 2020-03-11 07:00:25 <haus_realtor> What do you think of this theme for a nursery? It looks like they tried to stay gender-neutral, but the pink blankets give away the end result!  http://www.facebook.com/1979586545613472_2507916642780457 … pic.twitter.com/4IIQ5wreUm

1237550683156385795 2020-03-11 06:57:30 <SethRogan4Prez> I support Medicare For All because when I spent time with child cancer patients as a camp counselor, we gave some kids the first new today they received in years. I had 3 campers who didn’t even show up with pillows, blankets, soap, or shampoo.
1237550560443658240 2020-03-11 06:57:00 <SimpleLittleMee> My life is rushing home because I’m ready to be wrapped up in my blankets reading a book

1237550008913682433 2020-03-11 06:54:49 <phillylauren> This whole book is like “desiring to be unburdened of blankets and bread, I proceeded forth into the alpenglow to sleep atop the summit” honestly what the shit

1237545611919896576 2020-03-11 06:37:21 <RonaldBlankets> I'd be surprised if Trump agrees to any debates. He's already hinted at a future refusal.

He must spend several days burying and unburying it in whatever is handy (blankets, dog beds, sofa cushions, human legs).

1237531465652432896 2020-03-11 05:41:08 <HauntedNeedle> I wonder if there is not much demand for it there, I think it's most often used for baby blankets though 🤔 babies are everywhere

1237528447787749376 2020-03-11 05:29:08 <cczona> What I haven't figured out is the run on nail polish and files. I have never wanted a mani-pedi while sick in bed. Gimme blankets, water, cough syrup, and then go away.

1237521763765870592 2020-03-11 05:02:35 <YuFaSo1> There is a reason they are separated. Many are being trafficked through the United States others. Others are drug mules. What do you expect living conditions to be like. 5 star hotel rooms. We can’t house everyone but they have been given blankets mats and 3 meals a day

1237520330257653760 2020-03-11 04:56:53 <RonaldBlankets> Primaries make people silly. Give it a few months.
1237520152251392000 2020-03-11 04:56:10 <RachelLyn_Decor> So was TX. Hold your ground, bring them blankets and food!
1237520131120496640 2020-03-11 04:56:05 <TerriMS_Fighter> I forgot about the blankets and pillows.

1237519844892798977 2020-03-11 04:54:57 <Logan85775551> Perhaps just being a massive fatty in bed with the blankets barely covering you XD
1237519725988474881 2020-03-11 04:54:29 <Aprl24KT> The purple quilt is not my style and goes with none of our stuff but it’s his favorite blanket of the 5 blankets we have so it stays 😹
1237519525546844160 2020-03-11 04:53:41 <brookevitti> Some people bring their own blankets etc but I personally think hospitals are disgusting and if I did that I would need to throw the whole blanket away. Plus hospital warm blankets are 😍
1237519424870944768 2020-03-11 04:53:17 <NymphInTheWood> Oh no...Hurley is going to blame himself because he didn't bring the blankets 😭💔 and she tried so hard to tell them it was Micheal that shot her
1237519079336009728 2020-03-11 04:51:55 <memberhumanrace> That is insane, used to live in Fargo years ago. Bring them hand and foot warmers, hot chocolate, blankets so that they can stay in line.

1237518359089954817 2020-03-11 04:49:03 <MrStrayDawg> I just looked at their website. I'm amazed that they have only 15 locations, and the only three in the south are in Texas.  I used to live in Austin and went to that one. It's definitely an experience. They have these oversized seats with blankets, a full bar, and an amazing menu
1237518143108648960 2020-03-11 04:48:11 <TheMonkeyLou> 1 of those blankets merciiii

1237517973222350848 2020-03-11 04:47:31 <hb_builds> Our  3 kitty furbabies are so spoiled. They also let us reside here. Lol of they find a new spot we pull out blankets for them to lay on; comfort.  They have basically taken over the couch. So dont feel bad, there are plenty of us out here who understand.
1237517841823223809 2020-03-11 04:47:00 <VirginiaMohlere> Blankets are multipurpose
1237517789780496386 2020-03-11 04:46:47 <aschmugge> OMG - YES!!! I miss kitty cuddles so much and all my best blankets were chosen like 85% because they were the type of textures/coziness level that had been Riley-approved.

1237516363666620416 2020-03-11 04:41:07 <lapsedvinylgod1> Yeah! Because we’re all in line out in the cold with blankets, not like it’s a confined space. Maybe my gift bag will have a box of tissues and face mask. Wait, those don’t work for virus. 🤪
1237516004655337472 2020-03-11 04:39:42 <FluffyDryade> Drysana absolutely would fall asleep! She was out like a light, her head half tucked under the blankets and snoring quietly.  She needed to give Annie a proper thanks for taking care of her so often. A surprise present will be given soon enough!
1237515971859869696 2020-03-11 04:39:34 <BA2_Peterson> since cutting my hair I've instinctively started pulling blankets around my head like a hooded cloak to keep my ears warm and I crashed at a friend's place and the next morning she saw this so long story short I do actually apparently scowl in my sleep  pic.twitter.com/06hYtIM1qi

1237946146116513794 2020-03-12 09:08:55 <VioletAzimuth> All the above are great.Seasonings, because rice can get boring& vodka because things might be boring. But is good emergency wound cleanse if no alcohol.   Puzzles, books, crafts if you're crafty.  Candles matches and alternate cooking method if electric or gas is interrupted.

1237935953328644097 2020-03-12 08:28:25 <Kp0palypse> Take some time to destress/self care. Maybe light a scented candle or massage in some foot lotion if you have either. I find small stuff like that does help a bit.

If you are prepared with 2 weeks - 3 month supply for emergencies and you are not sick or elderly you will be fine. Also if you are afraid of the store - Walmart, Sam's, Costco, Amazon and others deliver.

1237915563491495937 2020-03-12 07:07:24 <BernieorRevolt> You all fail to see that Bernie knows how to reach out to his voters. Reversing what Trump has done is important but it's like blowing a candle out in a burning house. After reading these comments, I'm more certain that Biden will lose. Very mean spirited trashpeople on here.

1237910663982440454 2020-03-12 06:47:56 <heleenamck> There are lots of brands I splurge on from time to time. But usually, Homegoods/Marshalls/TJMaxx. They get luxury brand candles with really cool types/wicks/sizes and sell them at a fraction of the price they'd be in a department store. And bc they're luxury, they last longer.

1237900794571018246 2020-03-12 06:08:43 <inanitysgirl> I hate that. Sometimes I like doing a little crafting or obsessively watching Christine McConnell. Failing that come make candles with me or get me to give you some needleless filler until you feel better. Lol glowy skin helps

1237900436352319488 2020-03-12 06:07:17 <n7ekg> Sure! When volume and price don't move together, it's an anomaly, and you need to find out why. High volume and a narrow candle indicate a fake move. @annacoull explains it perfectly in her VPA book.

1237900131338338305 2020-03-12 06:06:05 <julesnewaddy> Sure it is.  You're voting for winning some, instead of losing all.  You're voting for the single candle instead of cursing the darkness.  And dammit, you're voting for RBG to be able to retire if she feels like it; don't tell me that's not worth a little compromise.

A candle in my darkest of moments and it destroys me that someone has made her light flicker so much she has felt the need to cover it, protect it. This fandom needs to look 1/4

1237895763243315201 2020-03-12 05:48:43 <Bahguette> My favorite moment in Divinity: Original Sin 2 was killing Lohse's demon without extinguishing any of the candles. By that point, I had stacked so much physical damage/Strength on Sebille that she just ripped his armor to shreds and stunned him while the mages blasted the rest.

Find things to incentivise yourself with to stay within your work zone e.g snacks, scented candles 🥪  3.

1237895217727987712 2020-03-12 05:46:33 <Eirenare> There's no confetti, cake or candles to blow out as Ben hits 31 aboard the Supremacy.  But Rey's there and there's warmth, peace, and when she bursts out laughing after a life of servitude to her grandfather's name, Ben cherishes the moment like the gift it is.  #ReyloMicroFic D3 https://twitter.com/rlogarbagech1/status/1234814258761760769 …

Some will say 100% all in, but if you're feeling a little comfy with your hodlings, it isn't too bad of an idea to purchase VERY strategic stocks right now.  Oil will probably do well if you buy a red candle, also energy stonks. And maybe toilet pa-wait  pic.twitter.com/IzYBAJTi9m

I saw $bac ans $jpm moving hard off the lows, $bac was the 1st one to take out HOD, so i took it at 11:45 candle and sold on 12:00 candle for a nice gain, but finished the day flat. I was ready to dump bac if it took out 11;45 low.  pic.twitter.com/OXYwFWrinD

"1237945025905987589 2020-03-12 09:04:28 <Nataya> It's a ""foreign virus""???  So Trump thinks it can only be brought into US by someone foreign   Or Putin told him to do it as another insult to the EU  Or Trump is just mad at the EU  Or  Emperor has No Clothes"

1237944988278784000 2020-03-12 09:04:19 <AmandaKathaleen> Kids section, regular clothes that get adjusted or they get custom made. From what I’ve seen on the little women series they have like waists and torso like average sized people it’s just length
1237944957991714816 2020-03-12 09:04:12 <Rini_azrrini> I am such a impulsive piece of shit who keeps buying clothes with no where to go and with no boyfriend.
1237944954518777856 2020-03-12 09:04:11 <VernGagne> Those were her normal clothes.   10/1 odds that Tawd was in a Korean massage parlor in Wasila during that performance.

1237944902798860289 2020-03-12 09:03:59 <foofthegoof> You know what's stupid, Islam existed in those areas for >1000 years but the cultural clothes supposedly disappeared because of it. Tbh westernisation slowly eroded cultural clothes as you said, also burqa and black clothes is more of a reactionary response to westernisation lol

1237944815666360320 2020-03-12 09:03:38 <PulpCereal> It's something you need. I say just do it. Just do it cautiously. Bring hand sanitizer, cover up, put your clothes in the hamper once you get home.
1237944801342951428 2020-03-12 09:03:35 <cooliej0> Before y’all get on me I changed my clothes because I like being comfortable and the festivities were over at this point

1237944768870711296 2020-03-12 09:03:27 <Sessahhh> Agreed. You gotta make sure you change clothes everyday. And take lunch.
1237944756069699586 2020-03-12 09:03:24 <Ebby_Gee> I am expecting a package of clothes tomorrow and you better believe I’m disinfecting it!
1237944737337925632 2020-03-12 09:03:19 <Bill_XCIII> I'm pretty sure putting Lysol all over yourself isn't a good idea.🤨 Though if I was particularly worried for someone I certainly would consider spraying down my car seat and steering wheel, washing up, and changing into some sanitized clothes before departing to his house.
1237944734552907778 2020-03-12 09:03:19 <CRlMSONCOCKATOO> i’ve come up with ways to prevent corona spreading :  1. wash your clothes weekly. the virus attaches to clothing 2. wash your ass. the virus attaches to you 3. drink water. water helps with anything  4. dont open your windows at all 5. fat niqqa whale sex 6. keep house heated
1237944732342464514 2020-03-12 09:03:18 <awkwabitch> He was DONE! We only fucked in missionary. I hadn’t reached my peak or nothing😢.. I got up.. put my clothes on & left. needless to say I was pissed. I blocked him. I don’t need half ass sex in my life when im walking around with fire box..

1237944693842792448 2020-03-12 09:03:09 <prestoluh> 45 can't bully a virus. Can't use Bill Barr to squash it, can't use #MoscowMitch to hold it up in the Senate. He can't rally against it, give it an insulting nickname, or send Rudy to open a fake investigation into it. He can't blame someone else. The emperor has no clothes.
1237944679821426693 2020-03-12 09:03:06 <there_there_now> We need to call Tomi Lahren's clothing line China Clothes because that is exactly what they are. We can't let her off the hook.

1237944672250507264 2020-03-12 09:03:04 <shanellewheatly> idk but hollywood is my least favourite store at gtc. the workers are always so bitchy and i constantly feel judged when i walk in. not to mention their clothes are wayyy too overpriced for the crappy material they’re made from
1237944658485010432 2020-03-12 09:03:01 <SplendentSweven> I'm not kidding either about that part.   I don't have any solid memories but I get like...feelings of familiarity.  When I was younger I described it as real things versus fake. Like linen clothes are real, polyester is fake, for example.  Real was what SHOULD be, in my mind.
1237944629632237570 2020-03-12 09:02:54 <cloth_clothes> 未満の対義語は以上ではなくて超過であるということを、わかったような気がするのと釈然としないのを行き来している

Remind patients NOT TO FLUSH THEM!!  Do a wash after end of, or halfway thru, the day to ensure there are enough.

1237937329052045314 2020-03-12 08:33:53 <Jade_HayanTokki> I cant do melatonin because it gives me night terrors. But I found that forcing my brain into mild activity actually helps. Basically role play by myself in my head while over focusing on stupid details. Like how the hair is braided and where the clothes flow.

1237937071827935232 2020-03-12 08:32:52 <vbspurs> Remember that my neighbours announced they were travelling to “Europe” for a week? And that mum thought it was to Cuba, instead? Now we are in a panic to make sure all our clothes etc are washed before they come, just in case we meet them in the lobby or in the laundry room.

1237936950595555329 2020-03-12 08:32:23 <10thFloorDiary> I just read the story in HT. Shocking how someone working in India, can shamelessly refuse entry to a guest wearing Indian ethnic clothes. Careless on another level. Glad you got an apology.  I'd be fuming if it had happened to me. A very silly mistake on part of this employee.

1237934472793739264 2020-03-12 08:22:32 <BIGBLUE585> Except where’s the part where they all try on funny clothes
1237934470809993216 2020-03-12 08:22:32 <KAYKAEKAYE> 😂 right. Very simple. With girls it only gets more complex as we get older. Our clothes are cheaper but it takes more work
1237934460865261569 2020-03-12 08:22:29 <lukesstench> You said it was over but your clothes said different on my bedroom floor
1237934415361257475 2020-03-12 08:22:18 <uglymensa> I have too many clothes and yet I still never have anything to wear lol
1237934399309504518 2020-03-12 08:22:15 <scottkeenan> I don’t think any of them are in touch with reality anymore. It’s The Emperor’s New Clothes. “You were amazing, Mr President!”
1237934389591490560 2020-03-12 08:22:12 <MarcelMagee> I stopped going they puss me off every time! No I don’t want $4.57 all these damn clothes and then they don’t be taking everything like bitch take it for a dollar I don’t want it

1237934299762044929 2020-03-12 08:21:51 <Only1EMARSH> I have to watch AGAIN. This episode hit on so many emotions. Joy. Pain. Love. Acceptance. Healing. I felt your scream (damn good acting) finding Maurice. Outrage at Gary getting locked up with no clothes. Disappointment. If I smoked, bow would be a cigarette break. ❤ thank yawl!
1237934299720138752 2020-03-12 08:21:51 <TikiRose> @GeraldoRivera Store up some useful items. If you wash your clothes in cold water, buy some Lysol laundry sanitizer. Cold water doesn't kill bacteria and viruses. Hit all of the things you hands touch with spray disinfectant - car door handles, exterior trunk, house door knobs...

1237934169310687232 2020-03-12 08:21:20 <h8cloz> Hypertension is another big risk factor. Scary thing is how fast it goes from mild symptoms to dead. I've read that it can go from mild cough to organ failure in 48 hours. Others just get sniffles and it goes away. This is getting scary,

1237934059122118656 2020-03-12 08:20:54 <StevenSooHoo> Honestly, the biggest struggle about working out for me is driving to the gym to workout and washing all the dirty clothes later 😂

"1237933996501278720 2020-03-12 08:20:39 <DianeDidi15> Now that's the best name yet!! WHERE does she find these appalling outfits? It's beyond me. It's like she's saying: ""Find me the worst clothes imaginable""! Charles really does need to stop the funding, at their age ""living off Daddy"" should be far too embarrassing for them!"
1237933995624669186 2020-03-12 08:20:38 <prez_worst> Does the woman own another pair of clothes. SMH!
1237933977442422787 2020-03-12 08:20:34 <Carmelamotto> Her clothes rarely fit.

1237933782977650694 2020-03-12 08:19:48 <lolohar0> the fact that it’s going to be 80 degrees tomorrow and i left all of my spring clothes at school

Rowena always had a way with kids, the maternal instinct kicking in instantly. She was a natural.  “Alright, take off your clothes, lass. You’re a hazard to that child covered in blood.”  Once the —
1237933748542373889 2020-03-12 08:19:40 <Crys_garcia07> I think this about Amina’s clothes! How much fashion will change when she’s grown! 🥺

1237933727369527296 2020-03-12 08:19:34 <SteveAllocco> Perhaps it's also a cost cutting measure in light of the drop in the Peter's Pence revenue stream. Prison labor is likely far cheaper than that of monsignors and cardinals with fancy clothes and erotic wall murals to pay for.
1237933719207510016 2020-03-12 08:19:33 <Peaceful1979> I know the sight of dead clothes when I see them
1237933719060656130 2020-03-12 08:19:32 <SecondInHistory> He'd look at them questioningly, he might have worn his own clothes, but he couldn't say he knew how to put on a cloak, or even a mask.  Trying to figure out how they worked, the cloak would be put over his head like some sort of blanket.
1237933693311819779 2020-03-12 08:19:26 <ProfYuille> Dear #academictwitter worried about your kids and partners in your online videos: don’t. I’ve been doing it for years. Just make sure they (and you) have clothes on before you start... and for the duration of the video.

1237933533735211010 2020-03-12 08:18:48 <ChildrenNeedUs_> It’s the splash back of virus as they spray that I’d be most worried about.   Ps: if you/anyone has a way of telling them to remove their work clothes immed upon getting home, put them either in a bag or directly into the washer. It lives for several days.
1237933516802813952 2020-03-12 08:18:44 <llauren_n> I drop so much money on clothes it’s bad 😅

"1237933487266484225 2020-03-12 08:18:37 <Adict_BTS> Yeah. Who needs professional stylists when you're the biggest band in the world... It's much better if you and your ""boyfriend"" fight over clothes instead."
1237933471194132480 2020-03-12 08:18:33 <chai_bobatea> So I had so many plans for thrifting but mom decided it wasn't safe because who knows how many have have touched those clothes. I can go to JCPenney though and get a bed set and clothes. The heck?
1237933467951923202 2020-03-12 08:18:33 <ghettr00> I don't cause I used to be unenployed and so I'd wash everything, wash my boots, wash the dishes, wash them clothes, wash, the floor, all bare hands, I couldn't want to wash my hands less than back then.
1237933459273920512 2020-03-12 08:18:31 <The_Evan_B> No clothes (or at least no suits), or no Evan/best man... Which would be worse? 🤔  https://twitter.com/lifeisfunnycast/status/1237928529674809344 …

1237933363651956736 2020-03-12 08:18:08 <KevinSandlin81> 2/x Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith!
1237933351773917186 2020-03-12 08:18:05 <queenbritaney> I just realized I ordered clothes from CHINA 😫😫
1237933345880735749 2020-03-12 08:18:04 <DaveBngDave> Is that like when you and your partner can't get out of your clothes fast enough when you're about to do it and the next thing you know the bra hooks are snagged in someone's hair? (not that this has ever happened in real life)
1237933333356720128 2020-03-12 08:18:01 <BIGGCHOPPA> only thing i hate about consistently going to the gym is i literally have 2x’s the amount of dirty clothes between that & work 😫

1237933293628162048 2020-03-12 08:17:51 <bluebir65798479> What does she spend her salary on, well it ain’t a hairbrush, and definitely not clothes, who wears pink in the winter, who votes for these ppl, she looks like a gypsys dog....
1237933268244164609 2020-03-12 08:17:45 <Sn0wkiss3sx0> Right! She can go waste her money all day on clothes but that's not me! I buy some expensive clothing to wear out or to a party. Not for work! Lame. 😅

1237931347588481025 2020-03-12 08:10:07 <CowabungaCarl55> Such respect for costume designers and other artists who get it down where you can describe the minutiae of their clothes and personality at the same time.   The effort goes under appreciated too. A side-effect is it’s usually attractive too, which is about as far as I understand

Extra precaution is to wash with clorox and water at a 1:9 ratio as advised by KKM. Avoid going to crowded places if you can, but if you need to, keep a safe 1m distance from people. #psa

1237930966707875840 2020-03-12 08:08:36 <K3s21> So true...the 'coincedences' and the simlar taste in songs, clothes, movies basically everything makes it seem as though they are the same person in 2 different bodies..lol..
1237930965458202624 2020-03-12 08:08:36 <dreayag> PLEASE, do not go into fitting rooms and try on clothes if you don’t wash your ass. It lingers. Enough is enough.

I've got my supplements lined up and I'm having to pack extra clothes in case I am stranded or quarantined while away from home. This doesn't even touch on the economic impact of my job either.

1237929649180680192 2020-03-12 08:03:22 <RubyMayCee> Pros of being 5' tall: can fit in small spaces, children's size clothes and shoes are much cheaper, can sometimes swing an under 16 ticket price at museums  Cons: everyone thinks they can just pick you up. all the time.

1237927609737998337 2020-03-12 07:55:16 <soda_minty> I love Bibi but how is stripping empowering?   I understand that you want to stop slut-shaming but that way isn't it. You can give a powerful message even without taking your clothes off.  I sincerely hope it doesn't reoccur, it actually makes me sad.

I'd also finally get a clothes dryer at home so I'm not forced to drive around town finding a laundromat as usually they're full. And get a bed, I sleep on wood.

You'd think she'd try to strip because she said that. But no, she's jumped over the sofa, running to the bedroom to put on more clothes.

1237926985655111680 2020-03-12 07:52:47 <bitch_poptart> You can feel yourself already dripping wet in your pants. You feel your clothes being removed, as your bare skin is caressed by the night breeze, feeling so much weight taken away with each article of clothing removed. Your body is introduced to something new: His tail.

1237926499195461635 2020-03-12 07:50:51 <katie_bratt> Maybe have him change his shoes in the car and leave them there. Also shower and put clothes in wash right away.

1237926495538089987 2020-03-12 07:50:50 <VagrantVestige> Awesome. I get your clothes.
1237926489863139328 2020-03-12 07:50:49 <AshinaGroyper> But arbitrary things like wearing female clothes, displaying womanly character traits or getting your nails done do? Fuck off.
1237926466207309825 2020-03-12 07:50:43 <__orgsunny> I sent about three orders of clothes to the school. I need that first then we can cancel 💀#Jackson_RYS20 #Tougaloo_RYS20 https://twitter.com/allaboutakevia/status/1237926108743577601 …
1237926457734615040 2020-03-12 07:50:41 <pinkichor> Kuroko is quiet enough to sneak up and leave a treat in front of kagami’s door and sneak back down undetected but then he really didn’t expect no2 to ALWAYS escape and wanna spend time with kagami without a treat
1237926435169296391 2020-03-12 07:50:36 <bulimicsnorlax> I can’t believe I have four hours of hanging clothes to do

1237926407134679041 2020-03-12 07:50:29 <KAYKAEKAYE> Okay so it wasn’t about the heel size in this instance but the style? I get it. Yes those shoes are very age appropriate I assure you. Lol boys clothes is sooo much easier than girls
1237926401262698497 2020-03-12 07:50:28 <KatyLoar16> My mom, jokingly: maybe you should have some clothes in your car in case something happens with COVID, like a quarantine, and you have to stay at your nanny job   Me, completely seriously: you'd be a fool to think I haven't already done that.
1237926397521297409 2020-03-12 07:50:27 <LoriNFiscus> I’m all for body positivity and feeling comfortable in your own skin but at least wear clothes your size. I’m not small by any means but you also don’t see me trying to wear size small shirts.
1237926365862793216 2020-03-12 07:50:19 <robertinkc> I get naked everyday. Who showers in their clothes?!
1237926360414371842 2020-03-12 07:50:18 <keathley2> I got rid of clothes to free up closet space for Chayden bc he said that I keep clothes I don’t need... he started putting his clothes in it tonight & he had a suit jacket, camo puffer vest, sweats that don’t fit him and a senior basketball warmup shirt.. I’m gonna kill him🤣
1237926354269736961 2020-03-12 07:50:17 <ZellerFeller725> I stg the mall is the most contextless place I've ever been. Went there recently and they had like famous people from tik tok there with their own stage. Turned the corner and saw a man in a cow costume and a mother and son in matching clothes. I fucking hate that place.

1237926351933517826 2020-03-12 07:50:16 <AfterDarkVal> I want people to wonder what horrors happened to you based on the state of your scarred skin and many times over healed bones. Wonder why an adult is dressed in little boy clothes and has a thankful smile on his face even in death.
1237926350637404161 2020-03-12 07:50:16 <sillyanonbird> I folded a whole basket of clothes. Thank YOU!
1237926333424041991 2020-03-12 07:50:12 <xFaMxKaiserx> When you have it. Just wash your hands, clothes, and keep your body to yourself

1237926105970958337 2020-03-12 07:49:17 <RealMG57> Sounds like someone is going to be shopping for clothes.
1237926104918364160 2020-03-12 07:49:17 <tacosntundra> The real embarrassing shit is too much for the mutuals. But I got caught in a parking lot of a mall as a teen, accidentally took his clothes too to hide my face from security (bc I worked in the mall 😳) so he had to make eye contact with the guard ass naked as we drove off 🤣
1237926104725323781 2020-03-12 07:49:17 <rodofdisaster> I’d add that you may want to consider an “air lock”. Clothes worn to work school are shed in a mud room or outer/isolated area and immediate body wash. It’s a little overkill for the typical citizen but your circumstance is different and stakes are high.

1237925955055824897 2020-03-12 07:48:41 <CarmenSD11235> I do darks, whites/colors, dress pants, jeans, athletic clothes, and delicates. I'll never see the bottom of the hampers.

1237937718413479942 2020-03-12 08:35:26 <shotgunner101> Honestly my recommendation is to collect as much non-perishable food as you can, medicine, water and prescription meds you get monthly. Then anything after that order via amazon, sterilize when it arrives and dont leave the house till everything calms down.

1237937397788262401 2020-03-12 08:34:10 <MrStrawCowSki> Yes, but what about the Ss who don't have internet?  What about the Ss who don't have food?  Creating a safe atmosphere is good, but there are other Ss who absolutely need the supports that our schools provide.
1237937396974583808 2020-03-12 08:34:09 <ltrainonaroll> no one reads my twitter but still maybe it's helpful. we organized a neighborhood pantry. it's split between two spaces - a house and garage - to which at least 8 people have keys. it has basic food, toiletry, and medical items.

Even the most processed vegan food is healthier than eating dead flesh that is pumped full of hormones and given an artificial color to hide that it’s decaying. Soy also has great benefits. You need to educate yourself.

1237937302065885186 2020-03-12 08:33:47 <VampOfThRose> You shouldn't be passive or careless, be cautious. Wash your hands before touching your face or mouth or straws or food. Try to not touch anything in public that gets frequently touched like buttons, doors, handles, light switches, etc. but if you do just don't touch your face!

1237937293165543424 2020-03-12 08:33:45 <giselxxo> You do have a valid point but I have seen other public school districts make it work. Washington has been giving out meals for students at 22 school sites. And the USDA has provided food for students at local churches, parks, and other community sites.
1237937290598658048 2020-03-12 08:33:44 <albaretoe> just the thought of all the money i touch, and grabbing menus at my job and serving other people food... i don’t even want to go to work anymore
1237937290384568321 2020-03-12 08:33:44 <Zray1109> the gov food aid in Wuhan was delivered by garbage truck caught by camera. residents were outraged. The community officials were censured  by this man for accepting the delivery. He was also questioning how the gov and market could have allowed this happened at the first place
1237937287402369024 2020-03-12 08:33:43 <LlcTerrific> There should be an available group of recovered #Covid_19 workers who can care for susceptible and  vulnerable citizens.  This way food delivery or amazon delivery is done with safe delivery people.

1237936777756921856 2020-03-12 08:31:42 <jeannius> well, handled food, if someone is ill... the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 9 days, if like other corona viruses...so it would also survive on food, packaging etc...sneezing or handling
1237936774837493760 2020-03-12 08:31:41 <andwal79> Once again government responsibility is shifted to the private sector. This is more #neoliberalism.   Glad at least those workers won’t have to make the decision between self-isolating or putting food on the table. But ALL workers should be able to expect not to have to decide.

The virus came from food that already contained it so it actually came from food/animals. Also, not all Chinese people are “nasty”. Some may just live in unhealthy places due to being poor, sadly.

We could have sat in my car to talk.”  Hearing and feeling her stomach rumble at the mention of Italian food, she acquiesced, giving a nod.   “That does sound better than a quick hotdog.”  It would probably be a lot >

This has caused lots of people to be confused about various things and many are still fighting in grocery stores just to ensure themselves that they can stack up their supply of canned food (3/5)

1237936064435814408 2020-03-12 08:28:52 <isteintraum> I will personally drop off food, water, toiletries, and bird/owl seed at Stevie Nicks’ home until this is over
1237936061461995527 2020-03-12 08:28:51 <ALYSSALUVSGAMEZ> If u take a girl to a buffet and pay more than 100$, and y’all eat for 30 min and barely touch your food ...SHE AINT THE ONE DUDE.  Get you a girl that gunna stay there with you for hours just to talk about nothing!!!
1237936060434243585 2020-03-12 08:28:51 <HollynEvan> 🤔 that’s food for thought. Good thinking!
1237936060258078721 2020-03-12 08:28:51 <ZTimewaster> People was starve. Not enough food on hand for 14 days.

1237936056294502400 2020-03-12 08:28:50 <JohnGuillero> Furthermore to try and fix the situation, they decided to cut food supply to Ukrainian villages, peasants were forbidden to leave Ukraine.

1237936047553679360 2020-03-12 08:28:48 <wendy_waterman> Yes. Most people if healthy should only go to work, school and food shopping. The best thing we can do is to stay away from each other
1237936044399607809 2020-03-12 08:28:47 <TheBagel44> Yes, because while the coronavirus is not getting better, why not? Ok sure, show your food! Lol
1237936039978618881 2020-03-12 08:28:46 <sloow_X> So since my mom passed away my nephew has had what we thought was just him being a picky eater but just yesterday we asked him why he didn’t like eating other types of foods and he said that he’s not gonna eat other foods till my mom comes back and eats with him 🥺🥺
1237936031250276353 2020-03-12 08:28:44 <OliveMaunupau> i have consumed so much food this day that i’ve mini barfed twice
1237936027710435328 2020-03-12 08:28:43 <Alexmipego> That's exactly how the system was designed to operate.  You know who can't revolt and overthrow the government? Those too worried about food tomorrow.
1237936024434675712 2020-03-12 08:28:42 <AtoxicPhantom> If you still consume foods that have gluten, do a test and stay for a long time without eating gluten.

Also you should all have a month's supply of food, water, etc.

1237936010383650817 2020-03-12 08:28:39 <zoeywhitewolf> I work in fast food. The amount of times someone is sick and still comes to work is often because we simply cannot find cover to work the shift.  I wish we'd close down when COVID gets more prevalent in my state aha

1237936009733648385 2020-03-12 08:28:39 <sldyer012400> Most of the universities close to me have moved classes for about a week but still keep student housing and food places open which is the best compromise I think
1237936003895177221 2020-03-12 08:28:37 <_Missjadeeb> Will be stocking up my place with food this weekend 😭

1237935999298285568 2020-03-12 08:28:36 <AddzyCM> Sorry was getting food
1237935991643467776 2020-03-12 08:28:34 <brampersandon_S> This is such a privileged and ignorant statement.  MILLIONS of Americans cannot pay their bills if they stay home for a full month.  Millions of workers are unable to telecommute.   When it comes down to it, the need to put food on the table is more urgent than COVID-19 risk.
1237935990745882630 2020-03-12 08:28:34 <jakesternberg> All of the canned food in the Silver Lake Trader Joe’s is gone, is this the beginning of the end? Will our heroes @LFAlbertsons save us?

1237935983020081152 2020-03-12 08:28:32 <Clockdockbee> I legitimately think she was making a statement about how our food is insane and over proportioned. Always trying to make it sweeter, fatter and bigger like the donuts in that shop when she said “I hate America”. As for the licking? Who knows.
1237935981791232000 2020-03-12 08:28:32 <sara_chidouin> imagine excusing racism. the virus gets cooked in hot temperatures anyways so yall r safe if its in food hello .
1237935977655459842 2020-03-12 08:28:31 <KingJohnBailey> I bought 2 packages in my first panic trip because it was the only palatable frozen food at the store. After eating my first pizza roll in a decade, I immediately regretted not buying more

"1237935962379952131 2020-03-12 08:28:27 <tottobutt> I was at McDonalds tonight and some guy leaned over the counter to look for his food and the lady yelled ""MOVE BACK, MOVE. BACK."". We are truly in panic territory"
1237935960014217216 2020-03-12 08:28:27 <LoveForgivPeace> Keep up the great work! I have so much respect for the work you all are doing. “It ain’t no fun if the homie can’t have none(career, food, housing, health, love, life, and family).”  I am so proud of ya’ll! “No fake nonsense here. Keep it 100 all day everyday”
1237935959343316992 2020-03-12 08:28:27 <stolentoilet> A man behind me at a drive through opened his car door and put 2 empty fast food cups on the ground . I calmly got out of my car walked over grabbed his trash and put it in the bin just a few feet away. Shame on his ass. Hope he feels like a lil bitch.

I don’t know why, but I thought I’d share that my mother had surgery last week and I’ve been helping her recover from that. So a lot of my time is focused on her this week since-

1237935954926714882 2020-03-12 08:28:26 <theponchito> Before you do that, I need legislation that will keep inflation down because Higher wages mean higher rents, higher food prices.  I'm paying almost $10 for a whopper with cheese combo already.  Everything goes up numbnuts!!!
1237935951940169728 2020-03-12 08:28:25 <Lynnisfine1> May there be blessings in the food you eat, the water you drink and the pillow you dream on. May you be prosperous and abundant. Asé

1237935949310541825 2020-03-12 08:28:24 <jessicawarwick_> I ordered food & brought into my room & proceeded to take a shower. I was rushing to take a shower because I was worried my food would get cold. That’s when I realized .. I have a microwave. So enjoy your showers. Stop rushing things in life

1237935942524076032 2020-03-12 08:28:23 <canelaandhoney> Apparently spicy food helps dopamine increase in your brain, so if i only eat hot cheetos for the next month pls mind your business
1237935933653225472 2020-03-12 08:28:20 <BehrendNinja> Yeah and then you come to the conclusion of a food choice. What are you feeling?  Tacos? Chicken? Sushi?
1237935933388972032 2020-03-12 08:28:20 <TheQuantumCat> Yeah, I'll feel okay as long as I can see the folks handling my food I think. Like subway/jimmy john's, five guys, etc

Just debating if I'm feeling it or not. :P I know a lot of people out there are afraid and avoiding it but it's silly to assume. Any fast food is just as likely as another.
1237935923880505344 2020-03-12 08:28:18 <KenVaughanSoc> When talking about social distancing, how total is this? Does this mean not leaving the house unless necessary, or moderating public behaviors and canceling large-crowd events? Told I’ll be teaching online now. I have a month of food. I’m wondering if I should ever leave home.

1237935879731032064 2020-03-12 08:28:08 <anng27> It seems to me that we follow the instructions for anyone at high risk. Stock up on food, TP & meds, wash hands, and stay home as much as possible. If you're employed & employer hasn't ordered telework, ask for it under ADA reasonable accommodation.
1237935879206952960 2020-03-12 08:28:07 <ColleenScanlon> But they will throw money at the shale industry and pay farmers for nothing.If he wants to help farmers make them grow food for the people that need assistance.
1237935879110504448 2020-03-12 08:28:07 <carl_a_watts> apparently we live in a world where the concept of human rights doesn't exist as long as a virus has a scary name attached to it, so, i mean, maybe they'll permit us to eat food every few days? what i mean is that you won't be getting free anything
1237935877818658816 2020-03-12 08:28:07 <S3vD3v> I got a infection two weeks ago, completely surprising. So, weakened immune system, I was part of the risk group for a while. Gladly I had stocked up food and stuff.

1237935861297229829 2020-03-12 08:28:03 <glenn_mcan> Schools should be open 365 days to the surrounding community to serve as a resource center, low cost food distributor and free drop-off day-care.

1237935852468211712 2020-03-12 08:28:01 <TrentFuller7> No doubt AOC is numb-minded. But don’t believe for a second corona came about as a food borne illness. If it was, it would not spread like it has. This virus and the disease it causes has the earmarks of a modified virus. It is highly contagious beyond what’s naturally found.

1237935704862265344 2020-03-12 08:27:26 <jgehrs1> Not a Dr, but that looked like a stomach issue, like food poisoning.

1237935699384578051 2020-03-12 08:27:25 <ZrnicZorica> Unless you cancel the whole economy then its going to spread. Which then places strain on NHS for years re lost tax revenue; increase poverty. And still some will have to go to work eg health service, shops for food, transport food, food processing etc More important is

1237935697559871488 2020-03-12 08:27:24 <Laurathefierce> I was today years old, the first in 35 years, when I prepared and ate onions in my food, instead of using them and picking them all out.  Who have I become?
1237935696561819648 2020-03-12 08:27:24 <PeachezMinaj> Like I made food and now I have no appetite and I havent really eaten today thank fucking you

1237935694414299136 2020-03-12 08:27:23 <GH_FightPoverty> I’m gonna brag for a moment about our son.

1237935694120546304 2020-03-12 08:27:23 <dmor94> I’m inundated with corona on my TL. Mass hysteria, NBA is shutdown, Gobert hate, flights cancelled to Europe, pray for Tom Hanks, Trump is going to kill us...in the middle of this crisis Han’s tweet appears “what’s the worst thing you’ve found in your food?”. I’m dead 😂🤣

1237935689704095746 2020-03-12 08:27:22 <Shaundrie> I don’t eat processed foods like that. However, my pantry is comfortably stocked. My freezer is also stocked full of meat and frozen veggies. The other stuff you see is “right now” food. Thanks for the concern tho. 💪🏽✊🏽  https://twitter.com/la_bella_amor/status/1237926813567012866 …

1237935685367222272 2020-03-12 08:27:21 <D_Liebman> Doctors and nurses indeed face some heightened risk amid this pandemic. But please remember, so to do: -phlebotomists  -LPNs -PCAs -sanitation workers  -technicians  -resp therapists -front desk staff -security officers  -food services   Often for less pay + fewer protections.

1237935678928728065 2020-03-12 08:27:20 <AnUnevenKeel> Are there any on call services to help with delivering food to people who are already sick but have not been approved for testing?   We need some extension of volunteer services to help people who are without help? Who has a likely source? Is the Red Cross able to help?
1237935676299120640 2020-03-12 08:27:19 <bentoalson> We plan to collect a couple of weeks worth of simple meals, not stockpiling unnecessary items, but enough food to hold us over if, for some reason, we were not able to go to the store. (It’s not a bad idea to have some reserves in general)
1237935676252770304 2020-03-12 08:27:19 <brewer_eddy> My wife made Chinese food last night it was delicious
1237935674591936512 2020-03-12 08:27:19 <taz45starz> It’s not the uber eats drivers fault. They literally go pick up the food and it’s sealed, by the restaurant, so there’s no way for them to check it. It’s the restaurants fault.

1237935672964587521 2020-03-12 08:27:18 <LindaHonsa> Why take away from SS and Medicare? Why not just help families who need paid sick leave and food assistance for their children? If workers aren't collecting a paycheck, a payroll tax cut doesn't help. Shame trump doesn't care about real people.

1237935665267924993 2020-03-12 08:27:16 <Capt_Carter_Roy> A real leader would’ve partnered with Jeff Bezos weeks ago and said tonite:  We will ensure every sick American gets food and medicine delivered to them and every hospital gets test kits. We’ve got this.  But he burned that bridge. And has no ideas. #TrumpFail #trumpaddress
1237935662306861057 2020-03-12 08:27:16 <Anime_TheCat> The biggest problem with staying home is how do low income individuals or families pay rent, buy food, pay bills, etc if they're not getting PTO?
1237935657135280128 2020-03-12 08:27:15 <arianaelena97> Hey! I just want you to know that your feelings are valid. I’ve been anxious a lot this week, too. What I’ve done is buy extra canned food + supplies & taking precautions with washing hands, not touching sfcs & face, etc. I’ve also took up some art!  Know that you are not alone😁
1237935653637091328 2020-03-12 08:27:14 <raretopaz> I think it’s a matter of time before someone in every school tests positive . That just means I have to buy more food. When these teens are home theyrequire 3 meals & snacks 😑

1237935650629914629 2020-03-12 08:27:13 <jgrvnt_2020> Be careful playing on the internet. Niggas will critique your food pics whole time they don’t know where their next meal is coming from.

1237935639770906624 2020-03-12 08:27:10 <sun_maize> Maybe they should go out and work to get a job. Then you can purchase food with the money you earn, crazy how that works. It’s their own fault if they’re relying on food stamps
1237935638466293760 2020-03-12 08:27:10 <misstxnbxnes> Home is starting to feel like home again, with my babies and my uncle. Cook us some food and just relax the rest of the night ...
1237935632468467713 2020-03-12 08:27:09 <malefica_lunae> Why do food bloggers write down their life story and a history lesson before giving the recipe? I don’t want to scroll for eight years I just want to look at the ingredients & directions

1237935590345248768 2020-03-12 08:26:59 <nikkilynnderosa> Also, I could name multiple programs that serve underprivileged children and their families supplying them with food and necessities to live on a daily basis. If there was a government mandated shut down of all elementary schools, forcing parents to stay home and miss work by law
"1237935590294736897 2020-03-12 08:26:59 <BirdingTrip> And the fact that no one comes to his ""rally"" meetings unless the Union tells them to.  Or there is free food."

1237935580828311558 2020-03-12 08:26:56 <RLippIII> Just saw a post of a middle aged woman bitching about a server error which they didnt bitch about it being the wrong food but it wasnt the special price they thought they were getting. Pissed off over 5 dollars.

1237935579540738049 2020-03-12 08:26:56 <MattWedgeDG> Well, I was trying to remain upbeat, but it's looking like it's time to go out and stock up on the essentials: scotch, Pedialyte, dark chocolate covered almonds, and cat food.
1237935576176906241 2020-03-12 08:26:55 <unclebluebird> But also, you're not supposed to trash talk food naa so maybe that's why

1237935572670451712 2020-03-12 08:26:54 <Bourbontruth> I like the idea about buying gift cards although risky. Food delivery dropped at the door better I guess. Getting creative helping staff also important. Perhaps go fund me for servers at your favorite places or pre-tipping? There must be a way.
1237935570124496896 2020-03-12 08:26:54 <sellpercs> I hate white bitches 😂 they’re so annoying I just want some fkn food.  pic.twitter.com/ZWhPieiS6L

1237935560381083648 2020-03-12 08:26:51 <dapplegraypony> cancelling everything puts people out of work and they can't buy food. so I am not too sure you care about anyone but YOU - got your hand out?   me me me

1237935548045471746 2020-03-12 08:26:49 <AmyThunig> I think, if at all possible, people should have food and supplies for at least 14 days in their home - because if suddenly having to be tested/self isolate, you can't exactly go shopping. News out of Italy is grim, I don't want to add to/rely on an already overburdened system
1237935547659796480 2020-03-12 08:26:48 <gomoneygoodell> Guess none of you heard about the concession stand worker serving food to fans at the XFL game in Seattle while he had the coronavirus. But go ahead. Play it like a joke.

1237935541238333442 2020-03-12 08:26:47 <CeeOh_Deaver> Get 5 friends together.  Go to Costco.  Everyone gets a cart.   Made dash to the food section, clear out ALL THE PEANUTS and fight over the last containers for good measure.  Mad dash to the front of the store to pay and leave.  Mass hysteria and national peanut shortage ensues.
1237935540768370688 2020-03-12 08:26:47 <cindynyuyseni> you ever eat food so good when it’s almost finished you’re like damn imma miss you
1237935540646936576 2020-03-12 08:26:47 <KellieMK2> Skyler and Will’s first date is the perfect first date.  We watch movies & shows & dream of these big, elegant romances. But all I want is the simplicity of an interaction where we can kiss with food in our mouths & laugh about it. #thesinglelife pic.twitter.com/kd8NnKJfs7
1237935538486706176 2020-03-12 08:26:46 <LoriPow73> I'm intentional about being healthy. I get vitamin D via sunshine, get enough vitamin C, I wash my hands, I don't smoke, avoid junk food & toxins, stay home if sick. I breastfed all 3 kids for 2 years each. No one caught a disease from us because we didn't have it to give.
1237935535949299713 2020-03-12 08:26:46 <emily_condie> Can we please kill the trend of calling  people who work at food chains “artists”? Trying to look at art jobs online and finding Subway sandwich artist positions isn’t exactly what I’m going for.
1237935533344452608 2020-03-12 08:26:45 <foxwounds> i wanna make food but i don’t wanna make food because it requires making food
1237935532811976704 2020-03-12 08:26:45 <CetnikPapi> You can stock up food all you want...  3 days after the Happening actually happens, someone will come breaking down your door, armed to the teeth...
1237935532740493312 2020-03-12 08:26:45 <GassyJalapeno> You know it Cj. Got the mortgage paid for next 3 months. Just got done with the utilities. Got about 2k in the bank. It’s taken a bit to grow that. We just need some guns and food provisions when we set the DNC ON FIRE and riot. 🔥🤓

They don't even get flu shots, stay home when they're sick, cover their mouths/noses when they cough/sneeze.   Ignorance is the most dangerous contagion.

1237935139172352004 2020-03-12 08:25:11 <OmHpCs> Good night everyone.   Wash your hands   Don’t have sex with a random girl from the bar until the corona virus goes away.   Don’t eat fast food right now because the virus can spread in French fries   Thank GOD for life and enjoy life.   ✌🏿 and ❤️ to all.   #CoronavirusPandemic pic.twitter.com/tGYDHzOZGR
1237935137607880704 2020-03-12 08:25:11 <TheQuantumCat> I think I'm going to stop eating out for a while. At the very least stick to places where I can see the staff that prep the food. Realistically a lot of people in food service are folks who can't afford to take time off even if sick, so...
1237935137414758400 2020-03-12 08:25:11 <stegso> I applaud efforts to reduce social spread of COVID19 🦠 by Universities, etc. 🙌 However, we must also consider accessibility (not only content but food access, housing, etc) to ensure equity. I am learning too so let’s keep sharing ideas! Thanks @jessyp for these ideas! 😎 https://twitter.com/jessyp/status/1237633585475174400 …
1237935136051609601 2020-03-12 08:25:10 <cfaaqhorie> When abah asked us to stock up food at home, and less going out also pasar also mall etc.
1237935134839472128 2020-03-12 08:25:10 <DustinCool_> If shit hits the fan... might as well stock up on food worst case scanario you have food. Best case scanario you don’t have to buy food for a while
1237935133296074752 2020-03-12 08:25:10 <Cabrde3> SOOO I have to adjust my fucking W-4 again?? Who needs a payroll bs “tax cut” if they have no income?  Paid time off is what should be required.  Food assistance, medical assistance.  Thankful I am not infected “yet” and have an income😡
1237935132180230144 2020-03-12 08:25:09 <shorts1000> You can't ever eat Chinese food again lol
1237935129793789952 2020-03-12 08:25:09 <adamluna> Mark Cuban is a legend. I wish other billionaires would do this for their workers that depend on each and every paycheck to keep food on the table.  https://twitter.com/jjones9/status/1237920928455155714 …
1237935126870462464 2020-03-12 08:25:08 <Hawaiian_Sophee> I didn’t want anyone jumping down my throat about it because you never know who relies on the school food but I’ll be damned if my child will be at risk over some damn riblets and crinkle cut fries. Stop having children and then rely solely on the school to  feed them. It’s weird
1237935124014084098 2020-03-12 08:25:07 <pitpitfernandez> Had a fight with her for the first time cuz of the food probably  pic.twitter.com/eJwJhIx42P
1237935123171020802 2020-03-12 08:25:07 <KaitlynFrisby> Live update from grocery store: way buys for 10 pm, people buying massive amounts of toilet paper and pet food
1237935115218509826 2020-03-12 08:25:05 <xoviiiii> That makes me wana eat the wrong typa food lol
1237935112848842753 2020-03-12 08:25:05 <SquizzRadical> No, I call it by whatever name the food is called.
1237935112173391872 2020-03-12 08:25:05 <SoftRegard> I don’t need food and drink I only need old man yaoi to sustain me
1237935108646146048 2020-03-12 08:25:04 <Obeydanii_> I really appreciate the days I have when I’m not sick all day and able to hold some food down in my stomach and today was one of those days🙌🏽
1237935108205744129 2020-03-12 08:25:04 <sabrinasblythe> you should buy the kitties extra food
1237935107618594822 2020-03-12 08:25:04 <HeyItsLeila> Thank you! I love food too. And when I'm not under any pressure/stress - nothing can stop me. lol But I'm not disciplined and stubborn = put work before health a lot of times. I've always been petite. With that said, any weight I've ever put on, I've lost.
1237935106708439041 2020-03-12 08:25:03 <WokenKurt> Also explains how China is the epicenter of these. Population density and their food markets. Covid19 jumping from animals to humans and how it happens. Also said this is beginning. 3-7 months he figures.

I’ll be buying as much of my food from the farmers market not the grocery store & try to focus on a plant based diet as much as possible. Until they figure out how this shit is truly spread and contracted I’ll be MIA

1237935101218041858 2020-03-12 08:25:02 <adwhorable_> it's been two hrs & i still don't have my food or money back.🙃

1237935098483408896 2020-03-12 08:25:01 <EricDino69> If fast food joints start closing down we're gonna have a fucken problem

1237935094280511488 2020-03-12 08:25:00 <sharkbuttboy> you think instead of stockpiling to barracade yourself in your own home from the virus, people would go after buying healthier food and improving their health habits to prevent themselves from getting sick or letting the illness kill them
1237935092867174401 2020-03-12 08:25:00 <Marathon__Ali> Yeah I’m not getting anymore takeout food either for a MINUTE
1237935091860623360 2020-03-12 08:25:00 <WST73> Next ball to drop. Schools will likely start closing along with many Fast food & Restaurants. Think we’re just seeing the start of this. Futures tonight an indication of more severe implications & measures coming.
1237935089046228993 2020-03-12 08:24:59 <JHScramble> I'm pretty good on junk food, worst case scenario.  Always have a bunch of meat frozen.  will defrost and cook if nothing else.
1237935087997652992 2020-03-12 08:24:59 <ElSqeej> Kid has Strep and Flu. Wife Flu. We are all on Tamiflu and I’ve slept in the recliner since Sunday. I’ve washed my hands so much they’re 100 yr old persons hands. I’m shoveling food and drink prison style upstairs. Tomorrow I will try to invade and steal the PS4. #WashYourHands
1237935085980200960 2020-03-12 08:24:58 <preble_katrina> Food. Corona is some ET based chemical they used to try to turn humans.

1237935081823571968 2020-03-12 08:24:57 <KenyPlays> I stocked up on a food and water a while ago, just kinda worry like that.   Today I just bought the bottles , ain’t leaving my house 🏠  pic.twitter.com/gQ3Uh9wk3m
1237935079403319297 2020-03-12 08:24:57 <DennisMenace54> Oh no......noticed plenty of them.    Always pick their ring after they dismount.    That's not hygenic food delivery.
1237935077969088523 2020-03-12 08:24:56 <giveitarest28> I had some in pizza and know I don’t like them but I’ve done that with so many foods in the past few years now
1237935076857581568 2020-03-12 08:24:56 <HannahBrugman> I’m finally giving in and ordering toilet paper and canned food on amazon.   🤷‍♀️
1237935070729703425 2020-03-12 08:24:55 <jamielevdan> Not just the research itself. The expectations (burdens) of reviews, people's abilities to focus on journal editing - esp for GAs who may be facing housing/food insecurity..... Like, my case (going up soon) shouldn't be taking up anyone's bandwidth right now
1237935069454614530 2020-03-12 08:24:54 <jadathegiraffe> U lucky. it’s not gonna stop for a minute tbh. Though I have a hunch that’s telling me black folks are least likely to get it but you never know. Can foods, gloves , alcohol, soap, etc was all GONE when I went shopping.
1237935068326154240 2020-03-12 08:24:54 <daellacious> It’s been a long time since I looked at food and think “omg so sedap”
1237935067734904833 2020-03-12 08:24:54 <da_mimkat> OH AND I get to take classes from home cuz everything is gonna switch online so I can eat real home food instead of crappy dining hall cardboard :)
1237935067508293634 2020-03-12 08:24:54 <A_presto1> Cat food, dog food, tea, chocolate, bananas.  https://twitter.com/anthonyjlang/status/1237911341626785792 …
1237935067252621312 2020-03-12 08:24:54 <Calgary8889> No cheat days right now... All that junk food doesn't help the immune system!
1237935063788138498 2020-03-12 08:24:53 <SteveWeatherman> HEB Hutto had some earlier today. I replied to @Bernie that TP is likely the most common thing someone would need to resupply upon (outside of food), so people are stocking up because they don’t know when they might be able get more.
1237935063251156993 2020-03-12 08:24:53 <PeteHarrisonNYC> I was a bartender for almost 10yrs, if it snowed on a Sat night, that could be a third of your weekly income gone. #COVID is so much worse.   The Congress needs to pass a stimulus for workers - not investors. Rent, medical, food. They need to start planning for it now.  https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1237904161385127936 …
1237935053918871552 2020-03-12 08:24:51 <ohnanette> Girl I can’t do that lmfao I’ll start focusing on ALL the dishes, next thing you know the food burned lmao
1237935052127780864 2020-03-12 08:24:50 <sarasmiles725> Disgusting, deplorable, despicable!   This is totally outrageous!  No more Chinese food for me!!!  Interestingly, I don't have a single Chinese friend in mind that I would love to yell at about this!  I'm boycotting anything Chinese from hereon!!
1237935051922460672 2020-03-12 08:24:50 <Ingramsfineart> Groceries first and nothing from a fast food place.
1237935049158393856 2020-03-12 08:24:50 <RyanFamily11> There’s your Chinese food prejudice; put pressure on your govt to stop violating animal rights/human rights/sealife/environmental pollution It originated in China - not racist. Fact.
1237935047879073792 2020-03-12 08:24:49 <_MissMokoena> This is always my argument . Skinny people eat an awful lot  and still don’t gain weight . So maybe , just maybe it’s not all about the food ??🙄🙄  https://twitter.com/fatnutritionist/status/1237800375043883008 …
1237935045324627968 2020-03-12 08:24:49 <crazyj1980> I feel like these people are really bad at disaster prepping. I would hit up food dtinks and the very last would be poop paper.
1237935042984198145 2020-03-12 08:24:48 <Jenthinksblue> I need to stock up on wine and cat food
1237935041340010496 2020-03-12 08:24:48 <jemmyatienza> that we've been through. An amazing year full of love, laughter, and even tears, with you. I'm looking for more years, you know that more years = more food right? Thank you for keeping up with my weird taste in food. And out of all the food, you are my fav LOL  pic.twitter.com/RsTNkrKr11
1237935039859412992 2020-03-12 08:24:47 <Ronaldjustin6> Annoying customer : kenapa tidak sedap ni makanan dia?   Bish you finished your damn meal and how is the food not good, you expect a refund ah ✊🤡
1237935037401772032 2020-03-12 08:24:47 <KStiz713> This #CoronaVirusUpdate really cramping my lifestyle. First no chinese food, then Pearl Jam show, now I cant even watch Tom Hanks movies.

1237935017877295105 2020-03-12 08:24:42 <jerry287141> Due to spending the first two years of his life locked in a basement with no food, this dog does not have the frame for obesity. He spends much of his time unchained outdoors where he runs and jumps and does doggy things.
1237935015511515136 2020-03-12 08:24:42 <coasterinoregon> He failed....and miserably.  Why did we not hear him utter tests, children, food, communities.  I cannot wait till we vote this failure out - he deserves to be and you as well after your presentations in Congress.

1237935002832310272 2020-03-12 08:24:39 <en_vy__me> I went with my cousins NO ONE liked their food & it was 7 of us at the time everybody got different meals, so Imagine that.

1237935000743444480 2020-03-12 08:24:38 <DavidT_Canucks> Most of the Chinese restaurants in US cities serve “Americanized” food, which IMO is nasty. I absolutely love and crave authentic Chinese cuisine.
1237934999216807936 2020-03-12 08:24:38 <AashSoSweet> When you go to a family friend’s house and the food don’t taste good. So you gotta put a whole lot in ya mouth before spitting it into the tissue lol  https://twitter.com/smoothg_/status/1236157660598239232 …

1237934997991915520 2020-03-12 08:24:37 <_laylowwwww> This why I don’t eat Chinese food now
1237934997002223617 2020-03-12 08:24:37 <notmeanspirited> nah, he's gutted democratic norms, replaced 1/4 of the judiciary (many of whom aren't qualified per the bar association), destroyed our international alliances & standing, erased economic stability, made our water & food more dangerous, befriended tyrants, the list goes on!
1237934996863803392 2020-03-12 08:24:37 <Christalynkbri> Trump is allowing Europe Food And Supply, meds, etc. that will kill us quicker !!
1237934996582584320 2020-03-12 08:24:37 <ctapio> I just left the grocery store. For one reason or another, I'm going to be eating a lot of canned food in the next month or so.
1237934994645045248 2020-03-12 08:24:37 <sundrxp> Bruh...it’s food. Like niggas can’t enjoy shit 😭
1237934992975675398 2020-03-12 08:24:36 <peabody007> Trump Please  Do a huge Racist Rally... Invite every republican supporters.. And serve finger foods.. We Dems will pay..

1237934992380121090 2020-03-12 08:24:36 <KieranChase__> No clue why you’re so defensive of your totally idiotic coach.  Even if it’s food poisoning, why in the ever-living hell are you out there exposing yourself to hundreds of fans, your players, and coaches considering what is going on right now? “Precautionary” must be lost on him
1237934990698205190 2020-03-12 08:24:36 <djclaws28> He's like a big baby when he curls up around his food like that

1237934960301887488 2020-03-12 08:24:28 <levi_bullen> I'm hiding in my house, but I live with adults that work jobs.   I grabbed a week's worth of food and some TP then went home.   But, if a guy who goes to church with a guy who touches a guy who works with my roommate gets infected....... I'm fucked.
1237934957747523584 2020-03-12 08:24:28 <JanHooope> I can’t believe I didn’t even realize and here I was with this mans face on food living in my pantry!! I thought he was just a cutie model they popped on the cover 😂
"1237934950302826496 2020-03-12 08:24:26 <Tocho_Prints> I say ketchup!  And he says ""oh yeah, that's right  I just spaced out there for a second  I'm really kind of burnt tonight""  And then he hands me the ketchup  And now we're finally drivin' away  And the food is drivin' me mad  With its intoxicating bouquet!"

1237934947551318018 2020-03-12 08:24:25 <MrCoolFacts> I went out tonight and bought a month's worth of food before every other asshole does the same thing
1237934947194806272 2020-03-12 08:24:25 <Bfklin> No worries. I enjoyed the different perspective and food for thought. Greetings.
1237934946439790592 2020-03-12 08:24:25 <krisa_forehand> some of y’all never ate food off the ground after 5 seconds and it’s really showing right now

The amount of time people spent sitting and waiting for a game that didn’t happen? I could’ve been working a shift making money but didn’t because of the game! Idk it just seems like too much
1237934923178283013 2020-03-12 08:24:20 <R1V3r5Jr91_XBL_> I do want to thank @amtvmedia for getting me into the food storage few years ago. Not just food storage, but everything else. Seeing people going crazy over all this and just knowing I prepared ahead of time is very calming.
1237934922435833858 2020-03-12 08:24:19 <marvin4420> I thought it was because I don't like that type of food wow

1237934879800725509 2020-03-12 08:24:09 <ChrisPParrish> Who avoided Chinese food? I’ve had it probably a dozen times since this became a thing lol  https://twitter.com/moranmarc13/status/1237738938460254209 …

1237934868832481281 2020-03-12 08:24:07 <CeliaHodent> So you should be fine. Unless they close down everything like in Italy. Which can happen. But then you can still buy your own wine and food. Anyway just holler if you need anything.

1237934859244277760 2020-03-12 08:24:04 <Capyrus> Why does money even exist? It’s kind of stupid now that I think about it. Everything should just always be free. If you want food, why is the grocery store holding it hostage? That’s our human right to eat. We shouldn’t have to pay for our life to survive!
1237934857269006337 2020-03-12 08:24:04 <AveryRaby> Damn it, now i'm jealous i just went to a mcdonald's for food. I need to stop eating fast food.

1237934822548373505 2020-03-12 08:23:56 <NewmanCostanza> Doomsday prepping is neutral for supermarkets, as sales will inevitably fall later.  Doomsday itself is bad for supermarkets as margins in fresh foods and discretionary items are much higher and sales of these will fall.

After recently becoming involved with a charity that distributes food to children I’ve been exposed to just how many kids need it.  Kick rocks

1237934791942602752 2020-03-12 08:23:48 <MAST3R0x1A4> Well I lived through Hurricane Katrina it is because they fear that the truck drivers will either Strike or be forced to not transport and so before that stuff happens people buy things like non-refrigerated milk, water, canned foods, things that may save their lives...Maybe...
1237934790004916224 2020-03-12 08:23:48 <pnmiller13> Lots will need to into that decision: access to laptops and devices, WiFi at home, babysitters, parents off work, food for kids that get free lunches, etc. I hope it’s awhile before that final call is made

Day 46: finally cleared for solid food & planning nice sushi dinner & cake, but then again maybe PB&J might be better way to ease your system back to normal.

Help to provide food and supplies, maybe make sure people stay self quarantined. Not fully sure. I do not think it is nefarious, but instead trying to help us. Just  my thoughts.

1237934667178876929 2020-03-12 08:23:19 <TheUberExplorer> . Wait...is Amazon making sick people show up to work? This virus is going to spread so fast if Amazon workers are showing up sick and handling food.
1237934663970295808 2020-03-12 08:23:18 <williamspaula> Donate to food shelters (now, not later). Voluntarily self-quarantine, especially if you are able to work from home. Have patience with the service industry who may be understaffed.  Operate under this assumption, “Everyone’s just trying to do their best.”  Do your best.
1237934659763351552 2020-03-12 08:23:17 <LibbyLovess> You can do like a spinach kale salad with tomatoes cucumbers whatever veggies you like. Avocado nuts any berries or fruit you like. Drink lots of water too they key is fresh food

1237934656735059968 2020-03-12 08:23:16 <RandySantel> If someone killed me or another human, in almost all countries where food challenges exist, the person would go to prison for a long time, especially if intent was proven, and I don’t think eating contests are an atmosphere where death via another person is a threat.
1237934652406607872 2020-03-12 08:23:15 <amandamont10> Haha I have a hard time eating the same cooked meal every day. Send me pics of it please!!! Her food on IG always looks so delicious

1237934649252470784 2020-03-12 08:23:14 <amrajabonline> Therefore I am free to choose, and Allah (the almighty) has given me the ability of choice.

I'll just lie in my bed, take drugs, stay hydrated, put a sign on my door and a greeting on my phone.  https://twitter.com/smasheroteacups/status/1237711457795608576 …
1237934639953645569 2020-03-12 08:23:12 <TroyAnd80823766> I am just saying that it feels like they don’t deserve our business anymore, at least when it comes to food. And furthermore it proves what we were already against in that Wet markets in China are Unsanitary and disgusting.

1237934539877556224 2020-03-12 08:22:48 <Blairthetrainer> A drink detox or pill detox is a laxative and/or diuretic. The term detox implies you are removing toxins, which is not possible. You can remove foods from your diet but you don’t need a “detox” to do this.

1237934281613287424 2020-03-12 08:21:47 <commonsense258> I was thinking food poisoning sick or cardiac. He look like he broke out into a cold sweat.
1237934281516822528 2020-03-12 08:21:47 <XennialDragon> I would worry to much. The idiot young yuppies will be to busy trying to figure out where food comes from if the grocery store is empty.
1237934279583248384 2020-03-12 08:21:46 <JoshuaSolomon84> I will need utensils, plates and cups for my food.  I will need appliances to cook and utilize the food.  I will also need appliances to keep my clothing clean and presentable.  Electricity and gas are needed at home.  These should all be human rights!
1237934279251746817 2020-03-12 08:21:46 <mak_jayne> Hoping there is still toilet paper and food at the grocery store tomorrow 😫🙃
1237934275321835520 2020-03-12 08:21:45 <boxweapons> Ive said this like 3 days in a row but i was so busy today i still need to go grocery shopping before all the panicking ppl have bought everything bc i have pretty much no food in my pantry or freezer just a can of beans and a can of broth
1237934273610633217 2020-03-12 08:21:45 <unclejeet> Washing your hands won't protect you from a co-worker who refuses to cover their coughs and sneezes.  Washing your hands won't protect you from a food service worker having to prepare your Big Mac while sick.  Washing your hands is the TSA of pandemic safety theater.
1237934273384140806 2020-03-12 08:21:45 <rajashripawar7> Do you know why it stared in China. It is because they slaughter all kinds of animals for food.

We can nourish ourselves by making food with good vitamins and minerals that our bodies crave.  We can go outside.  We can smile at each other.

1237934207311261696 2020-03-12 08:21:29 <LewdsnReviews> Let’s say you work at McDonalds and can’t leave work because no sick leave and can’t afford to miss 2 weeks or pay for test. Imagine how many bags of food you touch to hand to people.

1237934143259832321 2020-03-12 08:21:14 <KP11Photos> And when using your hands, sure you can be inefficient and get a bunch of food all over your hands while not getting much in your mouth, or you can let an Indian teach you how to properly scoop and push rice into you face whole so you get the best experience.

1237934126684147713 2020-03-12 08:21:10 <schroedingereqn> You can get meals through school programs once a day throughout the summer here in Florida.  As to your other horrible, duck starving children question, if you have ever had to go without food a day in your sorry life, you might know that you can live for 5 days without food.

1237934106022834177 2020-03-12 08:21:05 <PapaSmurfUTE> It’s one thing for NBA owners, players, politicians, etc. to cancel stuff. They are all 1%ers & doesn’t hurt them as much as the normal person. Those people need their concession job at $9 an hour, as their 2nd job to pay rent, or put food on the table.

1237934097835704322 2020-03-12 08:21:03 <GJMcClintock> Everybody, where possible should build up 3+ months of non perishable food. Two weeks is a great start.  You never know when something like this will happen, where you get laid off, etc etc. It’s always good to be prepared.

1237933910467784706 2020-03-12 08:20:18 <number420dad> I've been eating a lot of Indian food since they told me that, it's like spicy but the right kind??? If that makes sense??
1237933909821841409 2020-03-12 08:20:18 <Itsjenn2nns> The fact that people aren’t understanding the #COVID19US    Epidemic is wild to me. “Just was your hands you’ll be fine” ok, so when you’re trapped in your house with no food you’ll be crying “but I washed my hands every five minutes, why is my family suffering😩”

1237933905686257664 2020-03-12 08:20:17 <RepValDemings> As many Americans grapple with whether they can afford to miss work while sick, the administration will also be taking away food assistance.  Let’s be clear: forcing people to work—possibly while sick—to feed themselves and their families is not only cruel, it’s dangerous.  https://twitter.com/chuckabbott1/status/1237738144713314306 …

1237933735883882499 2020-03-12 08:19:36 <Dauntus> Hence persistence as a criteria. Imagination isn't persistent. No one persists as a dinosaur. New foods even persist as a different gender. But those who do need affirmation, because it's a brutal road harder than most.

1237933680594690050 2020-03-12 08:19:23 <jpas0123> Stay calm but watch developments. Stock up on food and other supplies, but do so responsibly—don’t hoard. Cancel trips and cut back on public events. Donate to your local food bank and help prepare vulnerable parts of your community.

1237933630938320897 2020-03-12 08:19:11 <LightningAuror1> 3. Stay at least 39,37 inch distance from each other 4. Do not go in any crowded places! 5.

1237933587690708992 2020-03-12 08:19:01 <RTerriers> Nutritional Yeast can add umami to foods instead of requiring extra salt. 😁 I eat very little salt, can't hardly stand chips & such that's too salty. Don't do sweets often. Honey can be used to sweeten foods vs sugars.
1237933586562584576 2020-03-12 08:19:01 <0neAnd_0nly> I can't wait 2 eat this food 😋😊😊

1237933579776045056 2020-03-12 08:18:59 <bpilk10> Man... it’s like the prophets and apostles have been telling us for years to prepare for world disasters and prepare a food storage. Good thing I listened 😅

1237933563049279488 2020-03-12 08:18:55 <divineangeI> Well I've been having dreams about the end of the world coming asap. I was getting the message that we all should start growing our own food and prepare for something big that's coming. This year felt really off in general but I couldn't put my finger on it until it all connected
1237933562956898304 2020-03-12 08:18:55 <NayfePacewell> For me it's not that big of an issue, but for most, among which are those I care for. Are more panicked about going without food for their family, then getting a little sick.  There is no saving on such a low income.
1237933562877403142 2020-03-12 08:18:55 <jonnynonames> Nope, I'm going to Fleet Farm...at least they also have guns and ammo in addition to food and toilet paper.
1237933561421926400 2020-03-12 08:18:55 <mom_ortho> So you waited too long to prep, or maybe you just realized you need a little more food than you already got. You go to the store and the bean and rice are all gone. Oh no!!!   Guess what's still there. Protein powder. Cliff bars. Pasta and sauce. Pickled vegetables. Go get these.
1237933558267863042 2020-03-12 08:18:54 <FMcwatermelon> The more important question is what will we do with all the beans and rice we stocked up on? Oh wait, we will have Mexican food for 2 years.

1237933557827489794 2020-03-12 08:18:54 <Aje_Monae> Now I gotta go food shopping before they od and close every supermarket
1237933556032253952 2020-03-12 08:18:54 <ICONOCLASTIAE> The food here is *engineered* to make you sick and the “healthcare” is designed to gaslight and/or bankrupt you.   Health insurance shouldn’t even be legal.   You owe lot think it’s normal bc you’re deeply brainwashed.  (That’s actually why my tweets frequently piss you off.)
1237933552408219652 2020-03-12 08:18:53 <mcloughlin_mara> I'm scared too but someone suggested organizing one's neighborhood to share resources (childcare, food) so that's what I'm doing to not feel as scared.
1237933552219668487 2020-03-12 08:18:53 <LuigiTancredi12> Is Coronavirus cancelling beach bodies too? Because if someone could put that statement out it would save me a lot more time for Netflix and junk food instead of the gym and meal prep.. #askingforafriend

1237933542857818112 2020-03-12 08:18:50 <fixedbuzzer> Tacoma closed and did it today.  They can deliver food to designated sites, museums Ymca, libraries are that are already open. Would you rather them eat at Covid19 infected cafeterias or use contaminated school bathrooms. Keep schools open ? Not enough hospital beds. Don’t judge.
1237933540995710976 2020-03-12 08:18:50 <1mudpuppy1> Maybe Rudy Gobert needs to pay the salaries of all the players, coaches, cleaning crews, food vendors, parking attendants, et al that will lose money/jobs because of the cancellations.

1237933516911976450 2020-03-12 08:18:44 <Midnight2310> I think everyone needs to slow down and take a deep breath.  It could be the flu, stomach virus, food poisoning or any number of things.
1237933506589671430 2020-03-12 08:18:42 <naikrakesh> Good for us... maybe our gene pool has resistance to these naturally, we are a hot and temperate place, our food esp being hugely loaded with spices which are natural antibiotics and lastly we are already sapped out by our politicians.
1237933506040397824 2020-03-12 08:18:42 <BadassBowden> Just wanna say that with the move, we’ve been ordering takeaway frequently- and we’ve made an extra effort to support local Chinese restaurants. Not only is the food delicious, but I like the thought of pissing off racists and supporting people who have been affected by racism

Long story short, when you ingest more cals than you burn, you store them as fat or muscle..

1237933382354513920 2020-03-12 08:18:12 <heytheredude> I'm having this weird problem where I look around and logically realize I have more than enough food to last me for two weeks but i'm still like OMG what if I don't?! I've felt for years that I need professional help with my crazy food hoarding but it's especially rough lately.

Vitamins come from the word Vita because their discovery was that they are required for life, but if someone has too much of any micronutrients it can be very dangerous.

1237933210086113280 2020-03-12 08:17:31 <jmtryneski> All I can think about rn is how Sanders administration would be rolling out rent and debt freezes and a food bucket distribution system in the face of corona and I blame @ramsincanon.
1237933209771552771 2020-03-12 08:17:31 <wahabzaidi1> @adeel_azhar bhai their is no mechanism to check hygiene of street food handlers ,, yesterday I saw  person with flu was making burger 😭kya karen bhai
1237933208785821696 2020-03-12 08:17:31 <pstanos> What if it is food poisoning? Pretty reckless of you to jump to conclusions, without knowing the facts.
1237933206328020992 2020-03-12 08:17:30 <babiejenks> A bit. I made food for tomorrow mostly. And did the dishes. Its like.... what are things to do in the kitchen.

1237933191740170241 2020-03-12 08:17:27 <grisaitis> Florida seems eerily relaxed with the #covid19 #pandemic right now.  Orlando Whole Foods was practically  empty (of people) this evening, and full of food! They were out of rubbing alcohol and wipes, but an employee said this was a supply issue (not local demand per se).  pic.twitter.com/wyUvFZy02C

1237933184890933250 2020-03-12 08:17:25 <JemUniverse> And if no bread then no raw fruits/veg either yes? Lots of packaged foods can’t be disinfected. Why specifically bread? Dampness? What if frozen first?

1237933172861677568 2020-03-12 08:17:22 <FullFrontalSamB> Gig economy workers deserve the same wages and protections as any employee. In a time when we're hoarding food and supplies, maybe we could support the people delivering those things to us. After all, they're the people who don't judge us when we order a single McFlurry.
1237933171347320832 2020-03-12 08:17:22 <sportskarley> Well, not entirely true. We aren’t hogging toilet paper or anything just stocking up on food  https://twitter.com/sportskarley/status/1237929174012014593 …

1237933143358873607 2020-03-12 08:17:15 <e_terren> I was doing something much more enjoyable than watching Trump on TV tonight. From what I'm seeing on Twitter, I missed quite the show. Yikes.   Now I'm going to go check my supply of soap and canned food.

Is it racist to say I went out and ate Chinese food when I really had rice, crab rangoons & mai tai's? Or italian food when I had pasta & veal? Idiots

1237933127647059969 2020-03-12 08:17:11 <Zeke_Cao> Food delivery drivers too. They are literally risking their health.
1237933124018937857 2020-03-12 08:17:11 <panda_navi> Idk why people think toilet paper first. Food is more important. Have people forgotten that you can take a wash cloth, wipe, clean it thoroughly, and reuse it for future wiping? There is no substitute for food for the human body
1237933121670176768 2020-03-12 08:17:10 <khinnenkamp> The Grand Solar Minimum will impact food production going forward. Inflation in food prices is the kind of inflation that hits the poor the hardest.

1237933113688219648 2020-03-12 08:17:08 <sayitlaura> The problem is... schools are being shut down & having food/healthcare is vital. What if the people that work in those fields fear getting sick too, they also should have the choice to stay home, but then what do we do?

1237933100509741057 2020-03-12 08:17:05 <grlz2grlz> Things will hopefully get better. Use this as motivation. When I feel that way I take walks (Pokémon go) or exercise. Go to the local gas station or walk to get groceries. Things won’t always be great and food won’t always taste awesome but know you’re not alone.

1237933001528545280 2020-03-12 08:16:41 <sportsfan8282> Very well said. I will also add pray for waitress and food delivery driver. As a food delivery driver I am require to physically hand off the food directly to the diner. Not living the food at the front door etc.

1237932824520425476 2020-03-12 08:15:59 <carissamxlellan> this is my petition to end the stigma associated with eating non-breakfast foods in the morning! ...sometimes a grilled cheese or leftover fettuccine alfredo be hittin at 9am
1237932821827555329 2020-03-12 08:15:59 <RawbertMeltzer> The markets are gonna go crazy. Idk what he means by CME but this coronavirus isnt a joke. Get supplies while you can for your families sake even of they think your just overreacting go and get food and water. No processed shit. Stop eating sugar and buy the things i tweeted.

1237932820431024128 2020-03-12 08:15:58 <Kalezzz629> I have to say it’s a thrilling watching everybody struggle with covid-19.... it’s kinda like hunger games! Will our government start quarantining us without food or water and/or make us fight for supplies of hand sanitizer?
1237932813975871488 2020-03-12 08:15:57 <heatherishangry> I keep wondering if they are going to eat toilet paper, because they need to put some freaking food in those carts.
1237932813955055617 2020-03-12 08:15:57 <Havethet1> Between the NBA suspending their season and COSTCO ending their food sampling, I'm convinced we're in deep doo doo.
1237932807420174337 2020-03-12 08:15:55 <nbeningo2> Seems like some of them are rather elderly, so not an idle speculation. Reminder that all the people that don't have paid sick leave handle your food, park your car, work the registers and take care of your kids.
1237932806602440704 2020-03-12 08:15:55 <seanthebold> Remember people, something often overlooked in home-quarantine prep is dog and cat food. They can’t prep for themselves! (At least mine can’t) @dog_rates
1237932801665765377 2020-03-12 08:15:54 <nifaaa2> I spent all my surgery money on sneakers & food wow
1237932798809231362 2020-03-12 08:15:53 <AmericanRose8> Already on the market.  My pet food store has CBD for doggos and kitties
1237932789313482752 2020-03-12 08:15:51 <Ondine_MD> Yes. And I learned early on not to give our Nurses fe Subway gift certificates, because they never had time to order, wait and then eat. It’s much better to send up the actual FOOD to the Nurses Station.
1237932785064689664 2020-03-12 08:15:50 <HunterBahamut0> Kotlet is a slavic food I've learned about, like a hamburger but with some more stuff in it and fried in oil rather than grilled or pan fried.
1237932782615224321 2020-03-12 08:15:49 <LenaxLlama> Kitchen Dog is making my anxiety a tiny bit more manageable so he should have like all the food he could ever want
1237932782170419200 2020-03-12 08:15:49 <SSlsg1> My point of view related to diabetes,  people got addicted to artificial sugar food life
1237932782074105856 2020-03-12 08:15:49 <0raProMe> Greasy salty food, liquids, and preferably a nap.
1237932777825284098 2020-03-12 08:15:48 <femjonkman> Nice to note, Jeremy; it hits the (morbidly) obese as hard as the elderly. This is not a large chinese/south korean/japanese or even italian demographic (despite the awesome food) so not seen in the data thus far, but I’m guessing the US will show the numbers.
1237932777678483456 2020-03-12 08:15:48 <Brianas_world_> Someone come with me for a late night drive and food 🥺

1237932771034558464 2020-03-12 08:15:46 <marmarbee> Pssst...hi! So, tr*mp’s temp proposals re:coronavirus- paid sick leave,$0 disease testing/copays, food security program expansion- sure sound good, eh? Now,what if I told you someone else wants to permanently implement those + more, who also happens to be running for president...
1237932767280693248 2020-03-12 08:15:46 <RENESZN> is this viet food
1237932766429351938 2020-03-12 08:15:45 <CaptainKnuccles> If the government wanted to they could shut off all our power and all our water which would take away most of our food supply and everything dawg
1237932763208171520 2020-03-12 08:15:45 <BPredict> You cannot shut down everything-but-grocery-stores. How do things get to the grocery stores? Truck drivers, gas stations, fuel refineries, dock workers, mechanics, and more... just for the deliveries. How about the companies making, packaging, and processing the food?
1237932762847469568 2020-03-12 08:15:44 <JWVerret> What US government needs to do now for stimulus is appropriate tens of billions for medical supplies and for delivery contracts with shipping companies to deliver food and goods to people in quarantine.  Also bulk up the internet infrastructure that will be shortly strained.
1237932760716783616 2020-03-12 08:15:44 <BlankSmash> Today was so good School online for at least 2 weeks Got chinese food Cuddles  Perfect day

1237932754588876802 2020-03-12 08:15:43 <theycallmeBigE> Bro idk what I’m going to do if I get Corona. I can’t cook and I’m going to need someone to drop me off some food outside my door for every meal. I might die, but of starvation

"1237932742798487553 2020-03-12 08:15:40 <SlasherTheMod> Slasher nodded and wrote down her usual, along with getting her a more cleaner glass. Sighing softly as he looked back to after turning in the order. Deciding to talk to her while the food was being made.  ""You know you come here almost every night and week. Everything okay?"""
1237932740076421120 2020-03-12 08:15:39 <MimieyLoma> I noticed the food delivery guys tu almost all ada the same smell. It’s from the uniform. Material kain dia cheapskate. Peluh sikit bau paya tropika. Kerja macamtu pakai kudrat mental + emosi banyak which i think highly of them. Not your place to judge them. Dasar gharik 🙄
1237932738709241857 2020-03-12 08:15:39 <jeaniceswift1> I know that many kids (especially the younger ones) rely on school for food and daycare, and calling off school may be unwarranted as it's only the beginning of it here in Ann Arbor. But the risks are high, it only takes one kid in a crowded high school hallway to cause chaos.

There are 1359 mg of polyphenols per 100 grams which puts it in the top 10 of all foods measured so far.  Vitamin D, as I understand it, isn't really a vitamin but a hormone. The best way to get it is sunlight.  Thanks for the info.

1237932405022838785 2020-03-12 08:14:19 <Cr3wBoss> The aluminum is there to boost body response to the vaccine.  Sugars/gelatin: Helps keep the vaccine effective after being manufactured. These are found in all sugary foods, like Jell-o.  Egg protein: Helps make EFFECTIVE vaccine.  Formaldehyde: THIS IS ALREADY IN YOUR BODY.
1237932403781505024 2020-03-12 08:14:19 <Do_Say_Action> I agree, but school lunches here are actually healthy and have to be. they almost stop serving chocolate milk cause of the sugar.  They should have housing and food.  Cost of housing is so high and wages so low that even these families are working.
1237932403357671424 2020-03-12 08:14:19 <Cr3wBoss> Thimerosal: Yes, this contains mercury. However, it is a compound of mercury. This is present in some fish and some foods. This prevents contamination of the vaccine.  Aluminum salts: You ingest these when you are drinking tap water, and some bottled waters, and health products.

1237932363474231298 2020-03-12 08:14:09 <Einstein_and_Me> The report is out that the virus survives in the air for hours. You display food with customers and your own employees talking over or around it. Maybe it's time to reconsider.

1237932357463744517 2020-03-12 08:14:08 <AudaciousBeat> So when they start calling for a quarantine in the streets, who is going to enforce that?  The cops.  When people run low on food, or their electric and water gets turned off, what's going to happen?  Desperate people + killer cops.  We have to get organized and prepared!
1237932357094694913 2020-03-12 08:14:08 <vlazlo2020> Excellent plan. Impeccable taste. I've been buying a few extra things for a month: two chickens instead of one; 4 cans of beans instead of 3, etc. Extra bag of dog food. Figure I'm good for a month as long as the coffee holds out.
1237932355232436224 2020-03-12 08:14:07 <shawnferry> I have one bathroom. I have locked the new kitties in the bathroom. I need to use the bathroom. I hear the sound of one of the food plates in the bathroom. I’ll wait to use the bathroom.
1237932352858255360 2020-03-12 08:14:07 <KP11Photos> Oh and don't let your plate touch any of the common area where all the food is. Imagine it the opposite of Korean food culture where everyone can eat from a common source in the center of the table.
1237932349884514304 2020-03-12 08:14:06 <GregFlippen> I suppose I wasn’t aware America is a food dependent nation.

1237932341751943170 2020-03-12 08:14:04 <cdemrys> My brain: Focus on what you can control. Make a list.   My list:  14-21 days worth of food  Home & body cleaning products.   Tylenol, Advil, cough meds, vitamins, Vick's  tea, tea, tea  Whiskey.  Wine.  Books.  More books.  Maybe some books.   Nice scented candles.  So much tea.

1237932319324979207 2020-03-12 08:13:59 <iveyjanette_207> And bars. Central will be a ghost town on weekends. I was planning on playing music this weekend next to the bars for tips,but I'll be at home instead. No one will be there,and neither me nor the food trucks will make money. A lot of people are in the same boat.
1237932318142033921 2020-03-12 08:13:58 <rudylopez> We went through the same thing here in Seattle. It was just today that they cancelled school. There are a million moving parts, not the least of which is what happens to the youngsters with no food or supervision if school is cancelled. My guess is that it will happen eventually

1237932315579482112 2020-03-12 08:13:58 <Model_Cherryy> I’ve been stocking up plenty food just incase an emergency .
1237932311670382599 2020-03-12 08:13:57 <honeynetalove> Like I’m supposed to fall on my knees & praise the greatness that is America. America is not great. All our food is poisoned. Corporations & pharmaceutical companies run our government. Cost of living is at an all time high & wages are at an all time low. Economy falling apart.

1237932304644833280 2020-03-12 08:13:55 <BnksMcho> All food is fire after a blunt but a bowl of fresh salad hits so different
1237932302400991233 2020-03-12 08:13:55 <A4Ny14> While you're at it, someone please tell @realDonaldTrump that massive amounts of goods (including food, mail, & medicines) are imported into the U.S via air on COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS as cargo - the same flights you & I travel on as passengers. The #TrumpTravelBan will be devastating.
1237932300576468993 2020-03-12 08:13:54 <FullFrontalSamB> Despite all its dangers, the gig economy can seem pretty attractive. You don't have to go to an office, you get to make your own hours, and if you handle food, you get to take a tiny little bite out of each sandwich you deliver.
1237932300458848258 2020-03-12 08:13:54 <FenGar> Eh, chances are that the plane will be nearly empty and she'd be in business class which means there'd be more fresh air flowing through. The thing I'd be worried about is the food or anything else that people touch.

1237932297430740992 2020-03-12 08:13:54 <Jlane03323668> Hitler Bernie Sanders is a disgrace, his dictator beliefs have no place in America. He wants control of every aspect of a persons life. He will tax you to death and give you a food line. He will get richer and be damned the people.
1237932296675545090 2020-03-12 08:13:53 <gallerychapel> I still can’t bring myself to buy anything chocolate-looking at a “natural” or health food bakery. Too many shocking carob disappointments.
1237932291218907148 2020-03-12 08:13:52 <Cudi60933280> @DraftKings @FanDuel  Your product got tainted tonight. I fucking go to Walmart, wait, no, I go to Target and I buy a tainted piece of food.  They're taking it back and giving me my money back right?  Step up
1237932289281032198 2020-03-12 08:13:52 <Loveevee_> My mom is freaking out over the corona virus so she deadass wants me to take her to buy canned/dry food and water 😭😭😭

1237932280825483266 2020-03-12 08:13:50 <dick_been> They don't care .... they believe it won't be their viewers.  The ones that are obese, smoke, drink ethanol, don't exercise or go to dentists, and eat the worst food on the planet - fried road kill.  *The most vulnerable*  HAH!

1237932273779032066 2020-03-12 08:13:48 <Ondine_MD> Seconded. Great idea. Don’t send food gift certificates because Nurses don’t have time to redeem them. Send FOOD.

1237932257245040645 2020-03-12 08:13:44 <CabreraChess> We were talking about how grocery stores are selling out of items and this kid goes “During times of panic, people hoard purchase things like bread and milk. What the hell, those are the two most perishable foods I can think of. It’s never anything canned.” My third eye is open
1237932251347849217 2020-03-12 08:13:43 <DaRealDarreion> Are we getting emergency food stamps? 😂🤷🏾‍♀️

1237932240841179137 2020-03-12 08:13:40 <geminiiibby> I miss enjoying food:( when I never used to be picky now I am. 😭😭
1237932240262365185 2020-03-12 08:13:40 <JohntheLib> So what do you propose we do to make children not food insecure?
1237932238655967232 2020-03-12 08:13:40 <M_Canadian> I have been making some bomb ass food recently. I jusssst made Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. I should’ve gone to culinary school 👩🏻‍🍳
1237932236634292224 2020-03-12 08:13:39 <Mani_Runs> Arizona? Ima bypass that for rn and talk about the food but damn I can’t.
1237932236407783429 2020-03-12 08:13:39 <LukeWilczak> That's just your tactic to not give me food :c
1237932233064722432 2020-03-12 08:13:38 <sh6rky> You lost yo damn mind if you think I’m supporting anyone selling me food made with Kroger ingredients.

1237932222159753218 2020-03-12 08:13:36 <lgsorceress> true. a lot of students will end up having to stay home, undoubtedly, but I have a feeling that the administrative parts (like food and social services) of the school system are going to have to stay open, just to fill in those gaps in the safety net.
1237932219534127105 2020-03-12 08:13:35 <Jel_ARMY> Do I get something back like for example food???
1237932216136560641 2020-03-12 08:13:34 <3dnailcandy> To be fair. French fries,  chinese food, hamburgers,  frankfurters, english muffins, Dutch apple pie, German potato salid, Italian bread, swiss cheese, Cuban roll, French/russian/italian salid dressing, Irish soda bread, and cheese Danish are american so maybe he has a point. Lol
1237932214685401090 2020-03-12 08:13:34 <iamburtjarvis> does anyone know how to grow food things? how do you plant a hotdog tree?

1237932207508983810 2020-03-12 08:13:32 <Emily_Butch> Me too, but instead it’s probably going to cost me my food service job which means I can’t pay my debt 🙃
1237932202253381632 2020-03-12 08:13:31 <Stu_Mundel> The food is amazing the people are super friendly and the service was sweeeeeeet!!! Definitely a new go to place for me!!!!

Just went to store and they are sold out of water and TP....very little canned food remain.  Stay vigilant, protect your families. After #NBA news....look for others to follow...🙏
1237932182074785792 2020-03-12 08:13:26 <MalletteSpace> Canned food is usually a dollar more or less but it adds up so try to cook your own. Or make a buncha spaghetti.

My good friend was an angel and dropped off two bags of groceries on the front porch. It's those sort of things that get us through crisis
1237932139301212161 2020-03-12 08:13:16 <SanceDot> Shit to get us through 2 weeks of not going outside in the event of contact. Fever reducers, flu meds, more Lysol spray/wipes, non perishable food items, etc.

1237932119558623232 2020-03-12 08:13:11 <DylanDaniels81> Thanks. She gets tested once a week because her mom is a nurse in the main hospital for their region. But Italy is basically all shut down. No bars, restaurants. Can only leave the house for food, special work and health. And it has to be approved so that’s crazy.

1237932089011470336 2020-03-12 08:13:04 <AnnaMarie_Panda> I wonder how many people spread and came in contact with someone, or something someone touched, that is infected, {or pre-exposed}, to the #Coronavirus with this madness.🤔 How many people touched that apple or canned food before you did, is definitely something to consider here.  https://twitter.com/ekem313/status/1237905599368658944 …

1237932080526434305 2020-03-12 08:13:02 <jlhcorley> Three weeks ago, my husband told me I was overreacting when I started stockpiling dog food and bleach. I never thought my extreme anxiety would actually be useful.

1237932073190666246 2020-03-12 08:13:00 <EdTheGrape> It's going down, I foresee food riots and Marshall law. Gov. Cuomo has already dispatched the national guard at New Rochelle. Trump will follow suit on a wider scale.#Resistance

1237932070669881344 2020-03-12 08:12:59 <DrZin14> You people are all so foolish and embarrassing. I’m really going to enjoy watching CNN finally throw in the towel before the year is out. Enjoy working fast food Chunky.
1237932069839237120 2020-03-12 08:12:59 <ESYudkowsky> Make sure you stock some of your favorite foods to go with all of that flour and oil.  For example, if you love avocados, make sure to buy at least 100 pounds of avocados.
1237932067360518145 2020-03-12 08:12:59 <onemillioncubs> I’m a meat and potatoes guy, too...but I love all food and my growing waist line is proof!

1237932051548049408 2020-03-12 08:12:55 <startdancinhoe> Y’all I’ve never been more stressed about being in grocery retail, it hasn’t really sunk in yet but if someone in Fairfax county gets the virus I will 100% be exposed somehow.

1237932050679607296 2020-03-12 08:12:55 <precatlady> This is why my first instinct [as someone who is on their own when sick] is to buy rehydration drinks and palatable bland food!
1237932049748692992 2020-03-12 08:12:54 <BlGBRODEAN> Dean sighs a little when Sam doesnt respond to him. He mustve been too annoying earlier. (He can't help it, being a kid again makes him wanna poke fun at his brother all the time.)  But then Sam pulls off the road, and Dean grins as he gets his way, his brother stopping for food
1237932046447763457 2020-03-12 08:12:54 <dogwings_water> That’s cool. I often work in the homes of rich old people (I’ve even seen a Trump inaugural keepsake it’s two.) I’ll just keep working through any illness so I can pay my mortgage and buy food.

1237932035479494656 2020-03-12 08:12:51 <vikalpv> It's the quality food that they eat and the lifestyle they have along with environmental quality that seems to the tonic.
1237932034380742656 2020-03-12 08:12:51 <IowaRed2> Here’s my opinion and it’s very unpopular but we are due for a major upheaval, war, disease, Biden. And if the population keeps going soon we will run out of food.
1237932033730473984 2020-03-12 08:12:51 <haley_hughess> If I survived the food the Pawtucket school system fed me, I feel as tho I have a fighting chance against this Coronavirus...

1237932019885035520 2020-03-12 08:12:47 <SocalDM310> Bernie,  The Coronavirus is what a real existential threat looks like. All these school closures give me a solution for affordable college. Online classes at a minimal cost. No student loans for ridiculous student housing costs, food costs, transportation, or books. 🙄

Once she had swallowed the food, she laughs.   “I’m pretty impressed.” She looked at him and smiles shyly. It was nice to share something like this with him.   “So,” she pauses and takes—
1237932012318621698 2020-03-12 08:12:46 <Chelsea_Roberge> Some students don’t have access to desks, school supplies, computers, internet, electricity, textbooks on reserve, and even food which can make studying of campus difficult 3/n
1237932008296325122 2020-03-12 08:12:45 <Punished_TB> Guys, it's racist not to be in the mood for Chinese food whenever you go out o eat. Wordsmith AOC has spoken.  https://twitter.com/NotSweetDeeSez/status/1237803055673946114 …

1237932006920450049 2020-03-12 08:12:44 <scttfrnks> There may be elderly shut-ins in your area and many local volunteer orgs do food delivery and the like. Maybe they could use more help at this time with more older folk staying in and not being able to go out and shop.
1237932005985157120 2020-03-12 08:12:44 <VioletIrwin76> Yes, my thoughts exactly. Toilet paper can be replaced with many many things. Food and water cannot. Hysteria makes people stupid.  https://twitter.com/conceptualjames/status/1237803319483142145 …
1237932004072738816 2020-03-12 08:12:44 <King_HCQ> When people post pictures of food with egg (especially boiled), I feel like slapping my phone out of my own hand 😷
1237932003284172802 2020-03-12 08:12:43 <SpiritbearNY> So true! I've done buffet style lunch from Asian delis. It always felt chancy. Luckily never got sick. The food was good!
1237932000620797952 2020-03-12 08:12:43 <grizzlymamabear> We ordered Chinese food night before last. AOC is full of nonsense, trying to divide the nation.

1237931985772797952 2020-03-12 08:12:39 <Oldgma3> As an older American &I don't thank you,Stefanik or Collins. YOU stopped working Americans from being able to quarantine! Tax breaks mean NOTHING if someone can't work. WHY? With NO paycheck they have no taxes! Can't pay bills/buy food/get medical attention. You're worthless!
1237931985030516737 2020-03-12 08:12:39 <mollyhendrixx> You would think I didn’t give Edyn a FULL PLATE OF FOOD. Miss mamas was in here eating off the floor 😭
1237931978843983873 2020-03-12 08:12:38 <BYourself9> I'm self isolating....stocked up on food  today and made sure my dad had food. Plan to catch up on some movies and books and go out as little as possible. Oh and I have LOTS of wine....you know....just in case I need to disinfect my innerds
1237931975651950592 2020-03-12 08:12:37 <chaaeewoon> But didn't people choose to avoid it because the virus is said to originate from China's exotic foods? Please enlighten me. :)  https://twitter.com/moranmarc13/status/1237738938460254209 …

1237931951144796162 2020-03-12 08:12:31 <Theo6777> Also panic at the grocery store for food and supplies. It could go deep
1237931948443656193 2020-03-12 08:12:30 <asassinscreeds> no he wants my food but i’m hungry
1237931948133085185 2020-03-12 08:12:30 <chad_mackie> Nothing like everyone high fiving after a McDavid goal and then eating finger foods during intermission. #COVIDー19
1237931947478798338 2020-03-12 08:12:30 <JaredMilrad> For decades, vegans like me have been urging the global community to adopt a plant-based diet & ban so-called “wet markets,” where live animals are sold & killed for food.  I hope the world will finally move in this direction - for our health & the planet’s. #CoronavirusPandemic

1237931931074871296 2020-03-12 08:12:26 <Ditzy_horse> I love the idea of sick people without paid sick leave going to work in our:  * Nursing homes * Home health care workers * Making our coffee * Making and serving our food.
1237931923802128389 2020-03-12 08:12:24 <connormblake> I’m a little broke right now so I’ll buy the plane tickets if you cover the bill for food
1237931922988417024 2020-03-12 08:12:24 <BallinWithColin> What happens when we all run out of food in 3 days and the grocery stores are closed...   pic.twitter.com/qwY6dgSNG5

1237931919423266820 2020-03-12 08:12:23 <SpikesForTikes> Stan nodded and hums, looking down at his tray of food. “Yeah uh.. Most people in this town are extremely boring. It’s always nice to find someone new.”       “Yeah! ha- uh...” He shook his head slightly. “These potatoes suck ass. Hey! What do you have for your next hour?” He-
1237931917674151939 2020-03-12 08:12:23 <GibsonLeea> I know it is an upset stomach and also what gastric means, but it’s what people say after they have eaten bad food or have a continual gastro intestinal problems. In Ethiopia, people  say, “I’ve got gastric.”
1237931914780200960 2020-03-12 08:12:22 <INAOTBBW> Finally waking up to this great country if ours are you? Everything is about making money not spending it. Also, the more people that die,  the more money for the survivors. Problem is money will be worthless. Water & food will be the real currencies.
1237931914645954565 2020-03-12 08:12:22 <chelseanewman> Today for the first time (I know) I went to @TJoesOfficial (we werent panic buying, we got wine/scallops/garlic.)

1237931913169580033 2020-03-12 08:12:22 <alexusl09> We just went to Walmart and spent almost $500 on food and basics. Only because my kids schools and my college are all talking about shutting down. Don't think I'm not prepared to spend 2 weeks stuck in the house with a 4 and 5 year old. This is serious!
1237931913085501440 2020-03-12 08:12:22 <mattxdaniel> Booze and cat food.  The rest will work itself out.

1237931912204779524 2020-03-12 08:12:22 <LENNYBE24058648> I don’t  like Chinese food.  No one hung low , for me.
1237931907431751683 2020-03-12 08:12:21 <carron_walker> Next time you go to your local supermarket take one of each can and put it in the food bank crate... Just an idea 🤔it's not like you are going to miss it... And yes I always do when I do my shop.  https://twitter.com/jadnama75/status/1237870593426350081 …
1237931905598849030 2020-03-12 08:12:20 <AC3_1990> Something to that effect is coming. Restaurants, food deliveries, mass transit will eventually slow down or shut down.
1237931901446283266 2020-03-12 08:12:19 <MyMikoy> That's not the point, sir. May priority system sila which is wrong. Let's put it this way, sa isang fast food chain na may priority lane, sinasara ba yung ibang lane para unahin yung nakapila sa priority lane? No. And ikaw na rin ang nagsabi na tulungan na lang? What happened?
1237931898116157441 2020-03-12 08:12:18 <KindaGwenish> Catch me in an apocalyptic situation offering up my body for sacrifice when we run out of food because by then it would be nice to die and also I just feel like I would taste better than most people 👸🏻
1237931892546117632 2020-03-12 08:12:17 <TKRelz> Someone find and ID the Whole Foods soup guy?

1237931889605980160 2020-03-12 08:12:16 <Overdosnreality> I've ordered Chinese all last week & I'm perfectly fine. Ijs... wash your hands. Don't share food. Avoid direct contact & you'll be good.
1237931886082654208 2020-03-12 08:12:15 <SherryHolbrook1> Buffets all buffets where food is exposed to many people and many people handle the same serving spoons etc. Why don’t someone take this shit stirrers stick away.
1237931885378121729 2020-03-12 08:12:15 <ZGroth> It’s day four of going grocery shopping for quarantine food. And it’s also day four of eating all my quarantine food in the same night.
1237931875534082048 2020-03-12 08:12:13 <jlhcorley> My husband told me three weeks ago I was overreacting when I started stockpiling dog food and bleach.

1237931870836240390 2020-03-12 08:12:12 <Phoebe17501437> They've really got to bring this food with a lot of vegetarian options to the Tropical Hideaway. Turn it into a full service restaurant where you can get more food with your Dole whip.
1237931870513291265 2020-03-12 08:12:12 <slliiimmmm> Aint no food in this damn house tho.. You think it's safe to still go get wingstop?
1237931870265868289 2020-03-12 08:12:12 <kaytwo5280> It’s bigger than food. There are kids who’s parents are working 2-3 jobs and don’t have the ability to stay home AND these kids are depending on the schools to feed them and keep them safe. Who will care for them?
1237931865996234752 2020-03-12 08:12:11 <DaRealRmunni> I still nyam my Chinese food same way,  I ordered my bundles from AliExpress and I’m good. Don’t make this government fool you bruv. Don’t know what their plan is but don’t be fooled.  https://twitter.com/moranmarc13/status/1237738938460254209 …
1237931863513026561 2020-03-12 08:12:10 <NorthCoastBlue> Mate, I was joking. After buying some decent food and maybe a chinese takeaway you might have enough to buy one share in AMP. 😆
1237931859910287361 2020-03-12 08:12:09 <DiamondofGarnet> Whomst tf is avoiding Chinese food?  I've probably been eating it more recently since I've had China on my mind
1237931859104808960 2020-03-12 08:12:09 <WildeCanucks> A little levity... I've practiced my whole life to be locked in my house with video games, food, and booze. This is my time to shine.

1237931855917309954 2020-03-12 08:12:08 <carly_castle> Yeah, exactly. Then economically, on top of the medical bills, those who will be hit hardest are those exact people who can’t afford to not work, even doubled for food service workers (etc) whose main source of income is tips, & no one is coming in for the products/services.
1237931855757725696 2020-03-12 08:12:08 <StewardessChick> Damn what do I want for dinner. Lowkey don’t wanna eat at any restaurant rn and I don’t have food at my crashpad 🤧

1237931822664777728 2020-03-12 08:12:00 <itspurpl> Dear restaurant chains:  Announcing that you're giving workers sick leave is not the marketing win you think it is.  Because people are realizing that sick people might have been making their food.  Dont be surprised if you sales go down for a while....
1237931822601981952 2020-03-12 08:12:00 <Sarah4Justice> The city can also set up stations where kids can get food if they need it. Projections show that if we don't do something drastic NOW, we will be like Italy or worse in 2 weeks.  It took Italy to go from 600 cases to 10,000 in 11 days.
"1237931822215913472 2020-03-12 08:12:00 <EthreainS> Our city may be COViD 19 free but the question is ""Until when?"" that's why we should always practice proper hygiene, eat nutritious food, take vitamins and apply necessary health measures. Keep safe!"
1237931822069305347 2020-03-12 08:12:00 <nowarning_> I gotta stop buying food when I'm starving.  I bought all this food and I'm full asf already 🤦🏾‍♂️

1237931817069694979 2020-03-12 08:11:59 <OklaEarthquake> Saying that most supporters are thinking there is going to be mayhem in the coming days as there is panic buying of food. These people have been prepping for this for years.
1237931815857520646 2020-03-12 08:11:59 <PinkStallionx2> i admit i could be a lil dramatic and let jealousy get to my head ! truth is i want everything all to myself (food,niggas,friends,and family ) idgaf 😩.

1237931815194652673 2020-03-12 08:11:59 <Frank61pc> Takeaway food not wrapped up in a paper package or a brown paper bag!  I think I remember when the paper package was newspaper.
1237931811826814976 2020-03-12 08:11:58 <maegwen> While you're out panic-buying, pick up a few grocery store gift cards to drop off at the local food pantry. Or donate online, it's easy.

1237931807728979968 2020-03-12 08:11:57 <_wickedgames> How are daily wage workers gonna self quarantine themselves? If they don't go to work, they won't make money. Rent, food, supplies, medical bills
1237931806059630593 2020-03-12 08:11:56 <meganfraser> I need to stock up on cat food and beer.
1237931804709052419 2020-03-12 08:11:56 <drwillazhen> Tipped workers in many states earn $2.13/hr. Federal minimum wage is $7.25. It is absolutely important to support restaurants (where possible & where personal health needs allow) because food workers need to support themselves and their loved ones. They can’t work remotely.
1237931803610157056 2020-03-12 08:11:56 <alexjing_> Those r fun~ not much in Scott's Addition tho? Lots of pricier food places around there 🤔 which one is the haunted place in tho!

1237931789290782720 2020-03-12 08:11:52 <SVVAYED> We could make an internet apocalypse-proof. We could make our food supply apocalypse-proof. There is so much shit that sounds like science fiction that could really be achieved with decades old technology. Maybe older.
1237931788380655619 2020-03-12 08:11:52 <j_king_melanin> Food money and weed?! Why not. We can order shit off amazon, smoke all damn day, and had a feast.

1237931743308435457 2020-03-12 08:11:41 <IrisPastora1> Someone showed my mom my tweet and now she invited me out to eat but before we even got our food she done pissed me off and she left so now I drove to Natomas for no reason so 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://twitter.com/irispastora1/status/1237756546706104322 …
1237931741534281728 2020-03-12 08:11:41 <CatPurry9> About a week after the annual show here, we'd always see an outbreak of influenza (and food poisoning and STDs) here at the hospital. Our ecca is relatively small. I can only imagine the disease risk posed by the crowds at the Grand Prix. #Covid_19

1237931729525993472 2020-03-12 08:11:38 <te_qa_i> Standard operating procedure of the old migrant owned shops in Australia. Lick fingers to separate bag from others. Blow into bag to open it. Place food item in bag.....😂😂
1237931725935628288 2020-03-12 08:11:37 <arkianghelika94> I agree with this. Those people on the top of the food chain will never understand. My family is scared of hospitals hindi dahil namumutiktik sa diseases and viruses dun, kundi dahil konting kibot mo kailangan mo magbayad.
1237931719220740096 2020-03-12 08:11:36 <WashedLifestyle> This is a good food take
1237931718587240448 2020-03-12 08:11:36 <lucha_lisa> Haha, true. What they don’t show is all the food. I have a family of 4, but I come from a family of 8. O well, no harm in those trying to prepare, I guess. Everyone’s different.
1237931717333110786 2020-03-12 08:11:35 <SuicideConcerto> @UberEats @DoorDash @Grubhub @Postmates  How about in the spirit of keeping people in their houses so the Coronavirus has less of a chance of spreading even more, you lower all those fees so more people can order food from home instead of going out.#UberEats
1237931713923334144 2020-03-12 08:11:34 <DeadRedWrath> Rodeos cancelled but I'm sure we can gather 20 crack heads and start something with some food trucks

He hid from any trainers that came by, only ever going out to steal food— the necessity only to be taken. This hunt lead him on the way to Wyndon, having climbed through the roughest trails of Galar, the icy cold terrain to the city —
1237931707371794432 2020-03-12 08:11:33 <KatherineGran2> I stocked up on booze, food, cleaning products, TP, more booze, medical products, and even more booze to last 2 months and that was 2 months ago😂😂😂
1237931706188992512 2020-03-12 08:11:33 <Mook_DontLoveEm> NOTHING beats snuggling with my kids while my son makes me imaginary food and my daughter smiles up at me. I love spending time with them 🥰♥️

1237931700497203200 2020-03-12 08:11:31 <OrcaBC101> That's gross, even without the corona virus. No one should be serving food with 'coughs' and 'runny noses' PERIOD!  https://twitter.com/pressprogress/status/1237850123800965121 …
1237931699318611968 2020-03-12 08:11:31 <GregoryWilli> I could tell you so many sad stories about kids coming to school hungry.  I can also tell you that there are wonderful educators at schools that make sure kids do not remain hungry.  If this Coronavirus continues many will miss the only good food they receive.  https://twitter.com/joycewhitevance/status/1237849167940083712 …
1237931696420458496 2020-03-12 08:11:30 <AlcinaMrs> If she’s doing Keto then she could eat like 10 of these. It would be “free foods”. I think she’s doing that diet plan through some company that she endorsed a few times? I looked at something similar and you eat small amounts but like 6 meals a day. I do think carbs are limited.
1237931695032205312 2020-03-12 08:11:30 <Abu_Sami68> I haven’t tasted this unhygienic food handled poorly and I am as good a Kashmiri as you are !

1237931682331754497 2020-03-12 08:11:27 <AnhurdynPlus> #gusandeddy Recently I went to a restaurant that I was recommending to a friend. The food was mostly stuff they liked eating, but when I asked them to come with me for dinner, they immediately didn't want to try it (they'd never been there). Do y'all also think that's annoying?
1237931680045899778 2020-03-12 08:11:26 <Ifedamola14> That’s a dead tastebud or inability to make good food themselves would make them manage anything they are served. That’s how some get poisoned

1237931625842913281 2020-03-12 08:11:13 <mickeyct_> Last year that happened while I was making it food. I sat in the kitchen and just buried my head in my hands for 10 minutes. That was my breaking point

1237931617349492738 2020-03-12 08:11:11 <obeetaybee> I worry about not having enough food to sustain us if we do end up self quarantining. (Going shopping tomorrow for a month o PB&J, bread & assorted dry goods.) I worry bcuz I have a yeast allergy and can not eat 80% of said dry goods w/o severe anaphylaxis. Fun times, end times.

1237931580795961344 2020-03-12 08:11:03 <Paul8K8> Woolworths has sent a notice to all its stores saying “No rain checks for excess purchases of toilet paper, pasta, canned food and the like purchased in times of high demand.” Apparently some folk are suffering from buyer’s remorse. Good grief.
1237931578686230530 2020-03-12 08:11:02 <MelKiperSr1of1> It’s really interesting that two celebrities get the corona virus and now everyone loses their minds.

1237931578225025028 2020-03-12 08:11:02 <MCSion67> That's because people are panic stockpiling which you would make go fucking insane by causing undue panic. I'm saying we should take a calm and measured approach. And food is not running out in many stores at all, early days yet.

If our fish would’ve had corona, we would have been the cause. And by the way, check mate is a really immature thing to say in a discussion

1237931532368535552 2020-03-12 08:10:51 <ACurriculumfor> Oh, today, my students heard all about the kinds of things that make healthy soil! And healthy food! I recently purchased extraordinary earthworm castings for my backyard, which I’m determined to transform into a LIVING food forest!😊🌱   I will check out: @kissthegroundCA
1237931530879729664 2020-03-12 08:10:51 <LaurenHaddock> On another note, I have not prepared at all and I’m genuinely low on toilet paper and food. Whoops.
1237931529952780292 2020-03-12 08:10:51 <Kalezzz629> Anyone who is avoiding Chinese food actually knows nothing about health or viruses.... worries me... like what is the health education in this country....?

1237931512890142720 2020-03-12 08:10:46 <MahouJomo> I hope people understand that even the ability to quarantine yourself is a privilege. Most people working retail, especially food service workers  don't have the option of getting to work from home. Many of them will either spread covid19 or lose their jobs unless action is taken
1237931504765939713 2020-03-12 08:10:45 <GJMcClintock> 1.  I can work from home I have good health coverage I don’t interact with any elderly in person I have food storage

1237931496599584771 2020-03-12 08:10:43 <dapapabear420> At least they are buying food lol. I would rather see that then TP. But yes fearporn and panic makes things worse sheeps are going rampant in panic mode making chaos worse.
1237931495647412231 2020-03-12 08:10:42 <PrestigeAlexis> People buying water, but not a brita filter People buying sanitizer, but still not washing they hands.  People buyin toilet paper, but don't buy food while they at the store???   Ya'll goofy for that logic

1237931486453682180 2020-03-12 08:10:40 <sgtis0905> @realDonaldTrump perhaps it would be nice to send either a small check or a food voucher to people on Medicare so they could order groceries by phone or computer and not have to go out in public.  @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson

1237931482389204992 2020-03-12 08:10:39 <VanLathan> If you were in South Louisiana in late summer/fall 2005, you know just how quickly civilization can seemingly get zapped out. No food in stores, curfews, etc. I’m in Wal Mart right now, feels eerily familiar.
1237931481932214276 2020-03-12 08:10:39 <ArchivistsRock> Weirdest grocery shopping trip ever. The grocery store was all cleared out of Spam (but there was plenty of toilet paper!).  Now I have a basement cupboard full of random ass foods that have a long shelf life. #BetterSafeThanSorry #PanicPressuredToHoard #MyCityNowHasACase

1237931473748934656 2020-03-12 08:10:37 <OzCazza64> Very true. Always great to see native animals released back as close or even to the habitat they come from. The Aussie bush is pretty resilient and some areas are growing again which is always good. But some areas are still receiving food drops for native fauna.

If anything food should be on your priority list, but your fruits and veggies and freeze them for future use. Freeze your meats, milk & bread if that’s a big part of your diet.   Grab your non perishable items.

1237931315653214208 2020-03-12 08:09:59 <CarolineTWilli2> I completely agree, I was trying to point out that we are dependent on imports for food. That is my only concern. Food shortage is a possibility... We do not produce enough food to sustain all Americans at the moment. Look at what we have to import, food wise.

Those signs you see in public restrooms reminding you to wash your hands, DO NOT IGNORE THEM. If you work in food handling, take into consideration everyones health & be extra sanitary!

1237931266105847809 2020-03-12 08:09:48 <Renoe> The problem isn't the virus itself. It's the way it's showing us how broken out system is.   It isn't about who catches it.   It's about the homeless kid who doesn't have food to eat because school closed.   It's about the cancer patient who can't get help because beds are full.

1237931166474178560 2020-03-12 08:09:24 <Zombryra> I swear, if this Virus keeps spreading and getting worse, jobs need to figure lay off, especially fast food joints. Work has been getting slower and slower everyday since it's been found to be in my City. This is mad scary...

1237931017752547328 2020-03-12 08:08:48 <cynicalVS> Food, water, medicine and sanitation demands are such that you can’t isolate everyone. Finding a cure is your only way forward. Else, it’s going to be endemic. Understand that and get on with life.
1237931015944966144 2020-03-12 08:08:48 <Thesjibt> This is a real question. I hope they find a way to help. Maybe a food delivery system set up by each school district? I know of many that depend on this. Let's hope some of the people making decisions consider the kids as well.  https://twitter.com/BeccaPanico/status/1237928555746639875 …

1237930808071110657 2020-03-12 08:07:58 <DarksabreGaming> Just spent $200 on canned food and hate myself for even doing it. Not one to buy into panic. My chances of dying on the drive to the market is higher than any virus, even if I did have it, but if it stops my mother from calling me every day asking if I’m prepared it’s worth it.

1237944703687045127 2020-03-12 09:03:11 <Thinktwicemore> Christy, he is not killing Americans. The virus is killing Americans. This isn't going to be straightened out for quite some time. The virus is in control, not Trump, and it is creating havoc because that's what new diseases do. There are plenty of medical experts say the same.
1237944691783581696 2020-03-12 09:03:09 <flgators1515> Stop clipping government media pics and actually talk to a medical professional on the ground. You are just embarrassing yourself.

Some states have already lowered/partly eliminated the costs for COVID19 tests, but still, it makes me appreciate our mediocre medical system.

Corona could be 250,000-450,000 by some estimates. It all has to do with how fast it spreads vs. our medical supplies/care capacity.  https://youtu.be/cZFhjMQrVts 
1237944639497351168 2020-03-12 09:02:56 <raeesahnm> I hate that it took a mass outbreak for people to realise just how fucked up the system is. Authorities are only realising now that no sick leave and understaffed medical centres are a massive issue.

1237944628415991809 2020-03-12 09:02:53 <Dear_Margo> I would rather rest and quarantine in my own home then in a hospital. Since they would only be giving me the same fluids and Tylenol I can take at home. Leave the hospital for people who have severe cases that require advanced medical care.
1237944624825741313 2020-03-12 09:02:53 <votejenngray> It’s a novel virus. We would all get exposed to it eventually.   The issue is the medical system. We have to slow the spread and not overwhelm the system so it can deal with all the gravely ill people that need help.
1237944618664087552 2020-03-12 09:02:51 <stunder> China built mega hospitals in a week.  American Healthcare is going to wait to see how it will be compensated.  I'm pretty sure moving away from socialized medical is the wrong thing to do.

1237944588406382593 2020-03-12 09:02:44 <DarrenKilminst1> There's not a credible source in the medical world suggesting mortality rates of 71%. If this is true half the world's population will be wiped out. What is being used to come up with those figures is statistical nonsense. If it's true the TP panic is sensible.

1237944578470301697 2020-03-12 09:02:42 <pschmitz1988> I don’t blame the NBA because it’s one of their players. So that team has to be checked and the others they’ve played against lately as well.  So I understand their decision. You can’t continue a season with 2 teams sidelined through medical. Perhaps maybe 3 teams.
1237944577346211840 2020-03-12 09:02:41 <TheFerrariLab> I agree that the number harmed economically will be larger than the number that will die. Many in th US haven’t got the savings to cover an unexpected medical expense - which is what this is, regardless of the severity of their disease.

1237944507833782272 2020-03-12 09:02:25 <MsRenButler> That’s awesome. Can they get medical care companies on board now too? My friends who are nurses are scared shitless about being exposed. They’ll have unpaid leave if they don’t have enough sick leave. Not ok.
1237944504558075905 2020-03-12 09:02:24 <parkrjay> It says a lot about your society when it takes a global pandemic to get a president to work with healthcare companies to waive medical fees associated with the #COVID19 test.  ¡Oh so it *can* be done!
1237944500913397760 2020-03-12 09:02:23 <crazyunlikeafox> Tough times for the UK, first that whole Brexit thing, and now Trump announces they are exempt from the ban that prevents other Europeans from suffering medical bankruptcy.

1237944436644028417 2020-03-12 09:02:08 <JHardwickDuffy> Because we don’t have the materials for tests.  1.Hospitals are out of RNA extraction kits to do the testing because of a hard hit flu season.   2. Many medical supply companies are in China.   #wearefucked

While the CDC & other medical experts are dealing w/ the virus in its totality... we also need to deal w/ our people getting paid for having to miss work. The stimulus includes paying hourly employees. Also, ALL virus patients will be covered!

1237944340422356992 2020-03-12 09:01:45 <David_P1975> There is zero issue with testing. The issue is people wanting to be tested with no legitimate medical need to do so.

And they have to deal with the people freaking out who think they have it as well. They don’t have nearly enough people to help everyone.

The medical experts on the line will determine if you need to receive further testing or go into some level of quarantine. Don't be shy to call, and don't worry that a call means you'll automatically be in a 14-day isolation.
1237943877178441728 2020-03-12 08:59:54 <chaossprite> I dunno I can do both hyperfocused text stuff and listen to details in human voice stuff. I just..often don't get a good mode of communication so to speak. Some people like to be chatty as a bad modem, others traumatize me by sending me micropackets about medical data with delay.
1237943866717696001 2020-03-12 08:59:52 <edooger> If the media is repeating what top subject matter experts from WHO, CDC, NIH, and our medical research university hospitals are saying, then maybe listen to the media on this one?
1237943862389325825 2020-03-12 08:59:51 <ICUStat> +/- 10 days, maybe a wee bit longer, given current trajectory.  Medical/nursing staff already thin. One break in PPE away from from having a few docs or nurses on home isolation would break the “system.”

1237943751185752064 2020-03-12 08:59:24 <nancy46846175> Trump’s action plan needs to be more than economic. We need more respirators, ICU beds, PPE, ventilation equipment, testing and surveillance. Hoping the medical system is not overwhelmed because that will result in needless deaths.

I think the major cognitive flaw to overcome is not realizing the difference between business as usual vs. Martial Law. We need Martial Law for tail risk.

1237943466732199939 2020-03-12 08:58:17 <mjsed12> Gotta love Twitter medical experts. Medical experts hardly know much about it, yet somehow Twitter is full of experts lol
1237943461137055744 2020-03-12 08:58:15 <MaisieDraws> This is getting too out of control!! I work at a Pharmacy store so I’ve seen how crazy it is too!! It’s hand sanitizer, hand soaps, toilet paper, medical masks, Clorox wipes and sprays, and anything antibacterial. Canned foods are also getting hit hard as well😩
1237943460285513729 2020-03-12 08:58:15 <classi_lib> Hard disagree. Wu-flu puts about 5% of the infected into hospital; w/ full care, it kills around 1% of infected while in care (10x greater than normal flu). Problem is masses of patients needing care dilutes medical care, death% rises significantly.  Witness N. Italy now.
1237943459417337857 2020-03-12 08:58:15 <davidcnswanson> No economic theory can change the medical fact that a lack of health care for some threatens the health of all. We're in this together.

1237943452903641090 2020-03-12 08:58:13 <MedicalSalesSol> Do not allow Biden voters to go to the polls for fear off an outbreak.
1237943450986831872 2020-03-12 08:58:13 <Most765> I was happy with the message. And we do live in the very best country in the whole world, with the very best medical care. We are blessed. Having said that, I really wouldn't mind if they just shut everything down till this is over!
1237943445840224256 2020-03-12 08:58:12 <SJSharks2015> Along with doing everything to be safe, let’s also lead with kindness, empathy and support for everyone we meet. There are and will be unprecedented challenges and now is time for patience. Big thanks to all first responders and medical teams. Bless you all
"1237943445114834944 2020-03-12 08:58:11 <JoshMosh138> Serious question. If someone were to have a medical emergency and no insurance, could they ""accidentally forget"" their ID at home, ""forget"" their name, SSN, etc, and still get treated at an ER?"
1237943442472407040 2020-03-12 08:58:11 <LibertyBell444> I don’t think this is overblown but I don’t think that we’ll be Italy either. Our preparedness and action steps are stronger than any country’s to date and our medical system and infrastructure is better as well.
1237943436633759745 2020-03-12 08:58:09 <kaitlinefree> Travel restrictions all of it. The medical I understand. You can't make tests appear out of thin air. But this was not taken as seriously as it should have been in the beginning.
1237943434008129536 2020-03-12 08:58:09 <parkin53722522> My solution to the coronavirus in sports First, we test and make sure that it doesn't affect fit, healthy people. Then we infect all the sports players that don't have medical issues (asthma, diabetes etc.) and give them a month to recovery and get over the disease.
1237943428484390913 2020-03-12 08:58:07 <SophiaB26432733> Not smart. They provide testing in South Korea and Germany without putting other people at risk because you stay in your car, attended to by medical personnel in protective gear.
1237943426051723265 2020-03-12 08:58:07 <caroldamnit> Why get tested if not having symptoms doesn't help anyone and a waste of the medical staff's time if I suffer from a fever and cold chills I will seek medical help
1237943425875484674 2020-03-12 08:58:07 <_TayLow_> That is very true, i feel like a Medical injury and a medical ILLNESS should be two separate things in a contract to protect some human rights but who am i. Ima try and research it lol

1237943398251794432 2020-03-12 08:58:00 <EmBeeRP> in the US, we publish so many medical research papers, but can't develop a reliable testing kit! isn't it just a rtPCR? such a shame.
1237943392153120770 2020-03-12 08:57:59 <MeowsticMix> People are still impulsively buying shit, only that shit is medical supplies that are needed by actual sick and disabled people.

1237943390244868097 2020-03-12 08:57:58 <jennydialcreech> HIPAA only violated if the doctor/medical staff releases the info, I believe. If Gobert told his teammates/coaches and one of them was the source, they didn’t violate, I wouldn’t think. Interesting thing to explore for sure.
1237943384062525441 2020-03-12 08:57:57 <InfraredXLI> The flu does the same thing every year. FWIW, getting a bead on this thing isn't something that can happen in two weeks. The medical field can't get it done that quickly. It's gonna take a little bit, but we're going to be OK.
1237943382569136130 2020-03-12 08:57:56 <thies_mary> Have enough ventilaters or beds in the hospitals to accommodate so many people. Italy has a socialized medical system.  Could this be why so
1237943381017464832 2020-03-12 08:57:56 <Aptharper> Then I was born and they actually found a better apartment in a safer location than where they started out.  Then I got sick. Really sick. Apparently, I was featured in medical periodicals nationwide. Their insurance afforded things like medical flights across the country.
1237943379230687232 2020-03-12 08:57:56 <Patty74515208> Vanity fair is not a medical resource just fashion ! Big if ,if people want to get real information go to CDC or a vetted medical periodical as modern medicine.

Or do you understand viral diseases better than medical professionals? If you did, you wouldn't be embarrassing yourself on social media ☕🐸
1237943371840344064 2020-03-12 08:57:54 <AustinM03010593> Yes because Trump was the one who opened medical facilities across the world and Obama was the one who closed them😂

I was on disability up until last year when they put me on retirement so I don’t get much and it is so hard to live on it I now have many medical problems

1237943343662972929 2020-03-12 08:57:47 <Tara_Sails> Happening to everyone. My medical office in Boston said they will test HIGH RISK only.
1237943341528100864 2020-03-12 08:57:47 <MacsimumMyers> I know what's going on. He's full of shit.  My father was a Cardiologist and my mother was an RN with a Masters in Gerontology. So really, the only difference between me and a real doctor is about 10 years of school and residency and a medical degree.
1237943339481272322 2020-03-12 08:57:46 <WTFAmerica11> You are just a tool of the right. His neurosurgeon has spoken. He released his medical records. His cognitive ability is fine.   He also wiped the floor with you candidate and is the presumptive nominee.
1237943335098212353 2020-03-12 08:57:45 <caw_law> You are hysterical. We don’t accelerate medical and nursing school training. No one is helped by inadequate trained people in the short term and definitely not in the long term. The issue is shortage of equipment.

St. Louis was conservative and helped keep the case load low and patients received better care which meant lower mortality.

1237943200385568770 2020-03-12 08:57:13 <MrFrankBaraan> Yeah. I know. But at least we can rule out lack of medical supplies as cause of death sana, instead of wondering what could have been had supplied been available.  But then again, hospitals should have enough inventory by now. So, DOH has to make sure hospitals are VERY PREPARED.

All your doing is spewing bs stats and reposting graphs and charts that smart people know are not indicative of the real problem.

The medical experts are dealing w/ the logistics of testings, quarantines... but we also need to — simultaneously — deal w/ the economy & make sure our people have jobs to return to!

1237942911754481664 2020-03-12 08:56:04 <GoonerGolf> Medical experts can’t decide because the ability to test all people isn’t there.  I’m in NYC, people are not being tested unless they are literally falling on the floor. Doctors don’t know what to do. People are infected and walking free and they don’t even know they have it.

1237942876996284417 2020-03-12 08:55:56 <jaymonopoly__> What if you don’t have medical insurance 🥴
1237942872684384258 2020-03-12 08:55:55 <realjennerblack> I think the bigger the crowd = bigger risk. I would defer to the medical authority of the state. They would have access to info about how the virus spreads,who might be more vulnerable, etc. I worry about precedent too and in this being a medical case I would go by what’s known.
1237942871451295744 2020-03-12 08:55:55 <RobertScalise1> I respectfully suggest a best practice of getting medical advice from reputable medical professionals as opposed to lawyers and/or non-medical talk show hosts.

1237942860210745346 2020-03-12 08:55:52 <leoniehaimson> This ignores the statements of medical experts who warn how kids can be effective carriers of the virus.
1237942855231926273 2020-03-12 08:55:51 <TinaBug23> The thought with closing borders is to slow the progress of spreading...... yes? Bc it’ll eventually make its way around the world. but if we close borders the overwhelming of our medical systems will be less bc it’s a flatter curve.... is thatvrheir thinking?
1237942852081971201 2020-03-12 08:55:50 <askwpgirl> What people aren't getting or failing to get is the large number of people who need medical care. Unlike the flu where people can stay home and suffer through it, the hospitalization rate for this is much higher, thus the fear is with overwhelming medical facilities' capacity.
1237942851079675906 2020-03-12 08:55:50 <graygoogirl> Please don't give me medical advice or weigh in on my personal life. You have no business doing so and it's quite frankly offensive.
1237942841940168709 2020-03-12 08:55:48 <ActuallyDSW> Nothing official, but hearing it is an abundance of caution for a potential medical episode suffered by someone involved with the game.
1237942841193697281 2020-03-12 08:55:47 <Tenshi_Akira> Well boomers would have to be expendable as they nonproductive as being retired or too old to be able to work. Not enough young people to carry the weight of their elders. Elders would be liability for the economy unless they are rich enough to hoard medical treatments and care.

1237942791424167937 2020-03-12 08:55:35 <oduwolefunky> Scaremongering encourages panic, I agree but ppl cannot be passive about this. This is serious. The public need to know the facts, be alert and aware and collectively fight against it spreading. That's the only way ordinary ppl can help ease the strain on medical professionals.

The gov’t would have to regulate medical prices (which in many cases is a good thing) just to keep from bottoming out.   The system would probably strain if not collapse under that.

1237942545117741061 2020-03-12 08:54:37 <Josh55032923> I'll be honest: anyone can learn cookbook medicine. The medical student, an NP, etc. But when that elderly Floridian comes in and it doesn't quite fit the treatment algorithm, who has the background to treat that patient? Not a midlevel provider
1237942543947632642 2020-03-12 08:54:36 <DANICAxDANALIx> I personally feel it's been super hyped up. It only kills 3% of people infected. So, flu only has a 1% mortality rate, but 3% is still super low. And that doesn't even include the cases where people didn't seek medical intervention. So technically it could be lower than 3%.
1237942543914074112 2020-03-12 08:54:36 <ChiefSpartan116> Biden just wants to keep expanding the already compromised and ineffective choice why don’t we just burn our money we spend for HC at least then it’s usable because the fact we pay $4T/y is bull shit that our medical bills are as astronomical as they are nationally.

1237942254213328896 2020-03-12 08:53:27 <SweetKeriLynne> …..that’s the nurse signing someone’s death sentence with her flippant attitude. That exposure will travel to someone vulnerable. How is a medical professional telling him this?! UGH (None of this rant is directed at you. I am just flabbergasted at people right now). (2/2)
1237942252111970304 2020-03-12 08:53:27 <HaleWhittingham> I didn't know that! That the point. Trump isn't a medical doctor either. He is just the greatest President in modern history.  pic.twitter.com/jKpRcq6grk
1237942247263363073 2020-03-12 08:53:26 <GD_Fraser> Agree that it is going to be very tough for medical people on the front line. Plans need to be put in place to make best use of scarce resources like you & your wife, while allowing for home duties. Eg rostering to allow you both to take care of kids if schools do close.

1237942203000819714 2020-03-12 08:53:15 <myprak> Just understand that a 96% accuracy if that means a 4% false positive rate, is terrible for medical diagnostics. If you test a 1000 people and expected incidence is 10%, then you expect 100 people to have it. You would get 40 false positives and 4 false negatives.

1237941997522112513 2020-03-12 08:52:26 <AvrahamAdler> It’s an almost certainty. The point now is to slow the spread so that this magnitude contracts the illness over a 2 year span instead of a 6 month span. The latter will overwhelm our medical system and G-d help us all in that case.
1237941996507082752 2020-03-12 08:52:26 <DocCav> And there needs to be clarification here. Insurances companies stated that they are waiving co-pays for the TESTING, not the treatment. You still get to bankrupt your family with medical bills if you manage to get your hands on a test and it comes back positive.

1237941936427872256 2020-03-12 08:52:12 <Fade14_> The author does not appear to have any medical or scientific background. All his charts are his own interpretation so everything should be taken with a grain of salt. It looks convincing, but it should be peer edited by experts before it is taken to seriously.
1237941936188575745 2020-03-12 08:52:12 <mykebartlett> Serious question – which official channels? Don't you think the panic represents a (perhaps justified) distrust of our elected leaders? Medical expert advice is, in some cases, at odds with government advice.
1237941931038117890 2020-03-12 08:52:10 <Sonia79089690> No sweetie... Trump is truly too stupid to know that. C’mon now.... it’s Trump.

1237941919151542272 2020-03-12 08:52:08 <mctarfu19611> I believe that each state probably has kits. A person would just need to find out where to go for them. As for all medical professional offices, I doubt they have any as of yet. So I agree with that one. CDC supposedly screwed up when preparing it, when it was in test stages.

It's the medical knowns, unknowns and social/geopolitical impacts in affected countries that I want to know about.  My investments? I have no doubt they will recover.

1237941336717885441 2020-03-12 08:49:49 <helloitsthao> medical supplies need to be made in the united states   but if we’re talking like pencils, toys, and usb cables, then yeah, mexico and india are perfect bc we don’t have a comparative advantage in those and they’re non-essential
1237941321106669569 2020-03-12 08:49:45 <GeorgeW40815291> @IngrahamAngle HANDLING CORONA IS A SCIENTIFIC ISSUE THAT MUST FOLLOW SCIENTIFIC RULES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY & VIROLOGY, NOT YOUR POLITICALLY CORRECT OR SOCIALLY CONVENIENT PREFERENCES! VIRUSES R A MEDICAL SCIENCE ISSUE ABOUT WHICH YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW NOTHING! HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE!??
1237941318623678468 2020-03-12 08:49:44 <the_queenmaker> I injured my knees, back and shoulder while serving in the US Navy which were the causes for my medical discharge 23 years ago. Now my neck is getting involved in the mix. This chronic pain is no joke and I’m tired. Literally tired of it. And there’s nothing I can do about it. 🥺
1237941311136727040 2020-03-12 08:49:43 <Plasticdoe> These are mortality rates. Maybe you missed the fine print. Of course mortality rates dropped for all causes when medical care was modernized.
1237941306501902337 2020-03-12 08:49:41 <BobbyGerould> (1/2) Hey Harvard medical. Does the coronavirus spread person-to-person?  “Yes, the virus can spread from one person to another, most likely through droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to 6 feet or so when an infected person coughs or sneezes.” Continued...
1237941303348023296 2020-03-12 08:49:41 <Risotto93779234> Because we have finite capacity in ERs.  There are literally no enough respirators in the US.  It's important for the rate to be slow enough so there's medical capacity to take care of the sick.
1237941297752592385 2020-03-12 08:49:39 <jocko__66> Government transparency in times like this is key in keeping the country at ease. I’ve only been lied to and denied testing from federal and local governments. Medical community should take the lead in times like this, but politics overshadowed that. No I didn’t buy toilet paper
1237941287183101952 2020-03-12 08:49:37 <manda_leigh2010> Wanna know what I literally CANNOT Look at right now????   @PerdsFacebook (not the twitter page. The actual FB page lol)  As a medical person. It hurts my head. Makes me angry. And I have no idea how to even respond to that level of stupid.
1237941284255522816 2020-03-12 08:49:36 <Barbdewar> I totally agree that we need more competition. That is becoming harder and harder as the big companies keep swallowing up the little ones. Medical research is not done that much by the big pharmaceuticals. It is done in universities and small research companies working on grants.
1237941284066770951 2020-03-12 08:49:36 <jude_scout> 1/ I’m blocking you after this bc I’m not going to entertain conspiracy theories any further but literally EVERYTHING you’re saying is conjecture based on no evidence except what you perceive to be your expert medical evaluation skills. I know you’re talking out of your ass bc
1237941281017360386 2020-03-12 08:49:35 <Nostranomist> Like me all this past month, you should be researching on how to:  Treat this virus as naturally as possible if emergency cases (not medical advice but personally using traditional Chinese and Indian remedies). Air humidifiers Adequate food and water Other stationary supplies
1237941278500884483 2020-03-12 08:49:35 <TheGreatAwake17> This is what a @POTUS looks like who really cares for the people!!! Unprecedented actions taken! US is the most prepared nation for this virus, by far, both from a medical and from an economical point of view.  @POTUS again outperformed every President who had office before him!! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237924069397467137 …
1237941274638004225 2020-03-12 08:49:34 <estes440> That's right, Isis or the Drug cartel etc. People who will inflict pain (Human Trafficing)on Americans or  steal our top security info and medical information.
1237941269671755776 2020-03-12 08:49:33 <SkyWriterAv> The medical risk is quite low (as I'm sure you're aware) and your employer will make sure you get home, even if that's via Asia. No disagreement on the simpleton, though.
1237941268191367170 2020-03-12 08:49:32 <chatiger> The last pandemic was a century ago,  there is no cure for Covid19, nobody prepares for an pandemic,  you want double the hospitals? Triple the medical staff? Kits that test but not cure? Trump is doing exactly what is needed.  Emergency prep has always been available.
1237941257655259136 2020-03-12 08:49:30 <max_burbank> President Trump is now barely able to read aloud. Wheezing, slurring, skipping words. There is visibly something medically wrong with him. We are in a crisis, and this sick old man needs medical attention. He needs to resign.
1237941253951631361 2020-03-12 08:49:29 <Doesntcomeup> Paying for Free medical treatment sounds like some communist propaganda
1237941251657338881 2020-03-12 08:49:28 <AndrewBellamy13> Perhaps a reminder is necessary that this is a rather unfavourable time to pretend to be a medical expert!!
1237941249920897024 2020-03-12 08:49:28 <timdgibson> They also don’t have religions. Stop with the “how Christians should respond” articles.   This is a medical issue not a religious issue.  https://twitter.com/emrazz/status/1237907090347343872 …

1237941248222269443 2020-03-12 08:49:28 <LeiSurz073> How can people do the math though when you Don’t know the amount of people being infected. Majority are as-symptomatic & don’t get medical help. They recover without medical care of hospitalization.

1237941225401077761 2020-03-12 08:49:22 <rosscantu_> Corona Virus survival rate: 99.3%. The .7% that were found dead, just happened to possess medical disabilities and (or) were elderly. Really sad to see how a virus safer than the flu is cancelling iconic worldwide events like NBA games, Coachella, E3, Pax, etc.

1237941196397465601 2020-03-12 08:49:15 <VaVaRiffe> No there isnt, read the fucking news. There is next to NO testing going on, its already spread all over the place & this admin is worried about is nbrs.

1237941177447522305 2020-03-12 08:49:11 <TheDreEra> During a confirmed pandemic it should be common sense for medical staff to check every single player before they set foot on the court.

1237941063513448448 2020-03-12 08:48:44 <Niquebtw> I intern at this addiction treatment center & the new medical doctor told the staff “u must treat these patients as if they were ur own family. Bc if u don’t and u mistreat them bc of their sickness, it will come back to haunt u & if not u, then ur children!!!”   Integrity.
1237941036988747777 2020-03-12 08:48:37 <jaycranfill> The season started in January???  Sorry, probably not the time to take this stance.  Never forget Rudy Gobert
1237941029493497859 2020-03-12 08:48:35 <Acertainsomebod> I’m much more frightened by our incredibly corrupt government,media,political dirtbags sold out our ability to survive something worse than this ridiculous lunacy.We have no meds,diagnostics,medical equipment,protective gear..All outsourced to China!Nobody has addressed it!!
1237941022992171008 2020-03-12 08:48:34 <Norm_Farrell> Kushner's expertise is not medical or scientific. It is in maximizing rents in slum level housing.  https://www.salon.com/2020/03/09/new-netflix-dirty-money-documentary-hits-out-at-slumlord-jared-kushner-a-tier-one-predator/ … https://twitter.com/always_vote/status/1237905863727185920 …
1237941020974673920 2020-03-12 08:48:33 <Fitzroy47> So its clear, there as it is here, that the real driving force was profit & tax receipts. Social and medical progress probably didnt get a look in.
1237941018345058305 2020-03-12 08:48:33 <PotamerMcGregor> I mean a pandemic has got to be at least approaching a “medical emergency,” right?
1237941017954877441 2020-03-12 08:48:33 <graygoogirl> I'll get right on top of that when I'm not working a full time job, going to school, and dealing with the insane costs of a medical transition. Your input has been noted.
1237941015325048832 2020-03-12 08:48:32 <Josh55032923> Sick attempt to come back at me though. Also, Pigman should not be allowed to wear the title physician because of his terrible life choices. If an applicant for medical school, residency, or a medical job had his legal and ethical resume, that's a big nope anywhere.
1237941013412491270 2020-03-12 08:48:32 <Quanos_> The reason they want people infected to be quarantined is because if he number of people infected overly exceedes a medical facilities ability to treat/test/diagnose the disease, the higher the mortality rate will be. They don't want it to get to a point where so many people are
1237941012258938880 2020-03-12 08:48:31 <PDArebellion> It takes me a lot of effort just to get a medical certificate from my GP due to being low on energy and overheated. It’s ableist to say I have no excuse. Getting down to the RPA would be difficult enough even when I’m well.
1237941009931108352 2020-03-12 08:48:31 <remikalir> smarter people than i have accurately diagnosed incompetent federal responses. but at the local level, in the hospitals, at least here in denver, i’m heartened by the medical professionals who will be caring for our neighbors at this time of need. thank you. thank you. thank you.
1237941002381529088 2020-03-12 08:48:29 <IzzmeeO> Do @TheDemocrats have some knowledge that no one else does about the spread of the coronavirus?  That probably means that until the medical community has the developed the knowledge to create tests, cures or other politically meaningful advances in production -You can blame Trump
1237941001920155648 2020-03-12 08:48:29 <chilllcity> Y’all taking medical advice from anything and anyone BUT WHO and the CDC. This why we getting wiped out early 😭
1237941000900939778 2020-03-12 08:48:29 <Zayn_M_Khan> This virus shows how unprepared the world is for a potential pandemic. We need to invest more time and money into medical tech and diagnostic tools because the virus has been out for more than a month now and we know very little of it and are far from developing a cure
1237941000447893504 2020-03-12 08:48:28 <DclemDeborah> Sounds like a good idea but they would still need the medical equipment and at some point that will become scarce if not already.  And a manpower shortage also.🤷🏻‍♀️
1237940998367350785 2020-03-12 08:48:28 <purejuice6> This guy is an opthalmologist and forensic body language expert.

1237940979170148352 2020-03-12 08:48:23 <kaymichelle0585> Because of a blood test? That’s bizarre. I often question how these people got into the medical field
1237940975835758593 2020-03-12 08:48:23 <HMKhanEsq> People are literally dying of this. Medical professionals are cautioning about this. This isn’t about ego.
1237940975076544513 2020-03-12 08:48:22 <mchrismc1> Vague ? There’s no plan , shortage of tests & inadequate medical supplies to say the least . It wasn’t  vague , it was non- existent.
1237940969535950848 2020-03-12 08:48:21 <mtvincent_> True but if you can’t afford a 3200 medical bill how you gonna afford a 3200 vacation?
1237940968734810112 2020-03-12 08:48:21 <KingCooleyXIII> Y'all are really taking these cheap flight out the country while people are being quarantined by foreign goverments?  Hmmkay. Is the $160 roundtrip to the Caribbean worth being stuck in a municipal medical facility for weeks or months?
1237940968000753664 2020-03-12 08:48:21 <Rogue2Riches> Don’t matter which virus comes in this world or natural disaster, I’m still required to go to work bc I’m considered essential medical professional. My bitch ass still gotta go to work to help u sickos
1237940963663704064 2020-03-12 08:48:20 <kristiwelshies> It is now about 24 hours later and we are up to 1311 cases and 38 deaths.I don't think people realize how bad this can get.Look at Italy who ran out of ICU beds and ventilators. China is giving Italy 1000 ventilators, and other medical equipment like masks etc.

1237940943703203840 2020-03-12 08:48:15 <LAFiorenza3> In Singapore, the government quickly canceled public events and installed medical stations to measure the body temperature of passersby while private companies handed out free hand sanitizer. As a result, the number of cases has grown much more slowly than in nearby countries.
1237940934404382720 2020-03-12 08:48:13 <mylittlebaklava> Not having medical coverage kills you in America. We in other countries look to the States and scratch our heads on why #M4A  is such a radical idea to so many Americans. Biden can’t beat Trump. @vpanzano
1237940926778994688 2020-03-12 08:48:11 <remikalir> i received amazing care from everyone at @CUAnschutz. every medical professional who attended to me, nearly two dozen in total, was so skilled, gracious and concerned. these professionals know they’re on the front lines, they’re planning, they're committed, they know it's coming.
1237940924547846144 2020-03-12 08:48:10 <drhay53> it'll be fine, you'll just need to produce the results of your test showing you actually have covid-19, fax it to three different people after putting in an official medical record request that costs $25, then hope they actually got it because whoever answers the phone wont know

1237940922232516608 2020-03-12 08:48:10 <careylunt1> @Mikel_Jollett my wife works in the medical field and I can tell you this: testing is available, however it is being done by the health departments. Unlike the flu tests, it can’t be done in an ER OR A DOCTOR’S OFFICE. Educate yourself before you start mass hysteria.
"1237940920689049602 2020-03-12 08:48:09 <chrishandjax> Respectfully, do you have any medical evidence which supports this ""reasonable chance"" theory about VP Biden's health? I'm not aware of any. In contrast, I am aware that Joe Biden & his campaign have shown great vitality in recent weeks. Democratic voters seem to agree."

1237940889768448002 2020-03-12 08:48:02 <zxq9_notits> The focus only need be in one place: repealing anti-competitive legislation and regulation that makes it almost impossible to produce anything medical domestically.
1237940882944471040 2020-03-12 08:48:00 <myblueheaven3> I hate to break it to all of you, but the only major politician advocating to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US has been Trump.  It’s going to be the lack of supply and capability of ramping up production of medical supplies that will hurt us the most during this pandemic.

We pay around 90 euro per month but the first 350-380€ in medical costs a year is ""own risk"" so we pay that.After that we get 100% coverage I dont know if we get tests free"

1237940506908184577 2020-03-12 08:46:31 <alexhilton> In which case, it makes sense for scientists with good ideas to approach NIH or the CDC so they can make that call and prevent duplication that would remove testing kits from a medical context
1237940500868431873 2020-03-12 08:46:29 <alexhilton> This is actually very reasonable. If a crisis necessitates breaching people's medical autonomy, it has to be accountable, not just a scientist with a good idea.

1237940494275096576 2020-03-12 08:46:28 <LAFiorenza3> In Singapore, the government quickly canceled public events and installed medical stations to measure the body temperature of passersby while private companies handed out free hand sanitizer. As a result, the number of cases has grown much more slowly than in nearby countries.

1237940429343121408 2020-03-12 08:46:12 <LynnHam21914711> That’s not true. Medical supplies from Wuhan had to be returned or destroyed due to possibility of infection. Once again, you either are misleading the country or as usual you are oblivious to reality

1237940425798963203 2020-03-12 08:46:11 <Stacey4UHoos> Hoping that coach is (going to be) okay. But perhaps coaching when feeling sick, especially with the current coronavirus crisis, especially having an underlying medical condition, was a big error in judgment. I hope he's okay, I hope everyone he came into contact with is okay.

1237940418077175809 2020-03-12 08:46:10 <KennnyZi> Just go ask any medical professional. Corona virus itself didn’t just start 3 months ago you’re an idiot.

1237939818140774402 2020-03-12 08:43:47 <JulesAlexan> I would ask a couple of questions: 1)How long after after he contracted  the virus, did the individual seek medical attention? 2)Did the individual come into contact with other residents of MD County? 3)If so, have the other individual(s) been contacted?

1237939786054340608 2020-03-12 08:43:39 <exile_van> There’s a lot of medical discussion on closing schools. Seems it may be a bad idea.

1237939611323662336 2020-03-12 08:42:57 <BroderWriter> Bless your heart! You have been through so much. Seems like we're living in a third-world country. Am ashamed and disheartened. How this kind of bungling can cost lives makes it more frustrating. But I blame the leadership--medical staff are having to ad lib without guidance.

I believe the entire mental health model is far less scientific and verifiable than the regular medical model diagnosis.

1237939590767546369 2020-03-12 08:42:52 <badhairday> That’s not even enough time to follow CDCs recommendation for self quarantine in the case of possible exposure, let alone the recovery time if you’re infected and end up needing urgent medical care.

1237939532949053440 2020-03-12 08:42:39 <myblueheaven3> Yes it was such great decisions by past administrations, both republican and democrat, with “government” experience, to find it perfectly ok to outsource all our valuable medical supplies needed to run our hospitals during said crisis.

1237939476753776640 2020-03-12 08:42:25 <CalandrilloChip> Or we could just provide medical care through taxation like we do for frivolous military spending and countless counterproductive wars.

I *am* worried about the massive disruptions it is likely to cause to our medical system, the economy, and to people's lives in general.

1237939013509615616 2020-03-12 08:40:35 <denise_greene22> With the recent cancellations of huge worldwide sporting events, I can’t believe that USAV is going forward with tournament play. I am not sure what “medical experts” they are discussing this decision with, but they certainly seem to be at odds with rest of the sports world.
1237939013299904512 2020-03-12 08:40:35 <AngelXu89428541> Wishing you and your family well!!! Personally I recommend your husband to have some medicine to lower the fever and your family to use medical alcohol cleaning all surfaces of the furniture. Keep the wondows open half an hour twice a day. Do these just in case🙏
1237939008522588163 2020-03-12 08:40:34 <BlackSundayTxns> It depends on how they obtained that information. If it was done illegally then, you have other legal issues.  Medical records are protected health info... And as I was saying patient can disclose and that's what both The Hanks and Gobert did.

1237938998527627267 2020-03-12 08:40:31 <keira_churchill> The “brightest and best” people you need to attract to the UK are not stupid. The people you need know they're not welcome in the UK even without the latest hole you've shot in your foot.  This is not the best time to further discourage medical professionals from joining the NHS.

1237938981356089345 2020-03-12 08:40:27 <lezleecog> It’s an unusual situation. We still have a chance to bring r0 down, flatten curve & avoid what Italy’s facing. Canceling Rodeo Houston, SXSW, etc., is hard, but mixing people all over state/country is a multiplier & great risk to elders & vulnerable patients in TX Medical Center.
1237938980127195136 2020-03-12 08:40:27 <renure> This thread is amazing - which is more important; the political optics or public health emergency is not how I want my country's crisis decisions to be made. Nor should the decision be debated by a corporate shill over an actual medical professional
1237938977396666369 2020-03-12 08:40:26 <MarineauMary> Tom is diabetic. This is a pre-existing condition and people who have medical conditions are more at risk!
1237938976180314115 2020-03-12 08:40:26 <TavviEnderlin> So if you get the virus you either have to die or live long enough to have crippling medical debt 🤔
1237938975882412032 2020-03-12 08:40:26 <IndigoARose> As medical personnel, This virus is more dangerous then the regular flu? What U always have done, but  If this crap goes 2 ur lungs & U have trouble breathing, go 2 the hospital ASAP! The elderly R more @ risk, but can effect any1 especially w a weak immune system!
1237938962284642304 2020-03-12 08:40:23 <SVG_Brandon> This Facebook friend of mine was a total jackass in high school and now he's smarter than all of the scientists studying climate change and medical professionals tracking coronavirus. What a glow up!

1237938940771889153 2020-03-12 08:40:17 <RexBaker2> How about covering COVID-19 medical costs for everyone in the country?
1237938939266248710 2020-03-12 08:40:17 <janesnage> Support our medical teams..ems, nurses, etc. Help them where you can.
1237938939140485122 2020-03-12 08:40:17 <JennyButtaccio> Exactly! This is bigger, and it’s important that we work to contain the spread. But I see so many people saying it’s no big deal. Meanwhile, I’m reading medical repeats for Italy that paints a very different picture.
1237938938607816706 2020-03-12 08:40:17 <LaurieSpoon> It’s over and that idiot deBlasio told New Yorkers it’s okay to dinner. And he said on @JoeNBC’s show that you can only get the virus if you were right on top of someone who is infected. Droplets travel up to 6 feet according to ALL medical sources. Bernie can drop out anytime
1237938938251272192 2020-03-12 08:40:17 <Dragonsbane628> I get it I’m in the medical field albeit veterinary but yes I have been told unless I’m on deathbed I have to schlep in and treat the sick animals, they do caveat that I wouldn’t have to see their owners though to prevent infection if it came to this
1237938935323639810 2020-03-12 08:40:16 <TonyMon65372105> It appears as if the Corona virus may be 10 times as deadly as the flu. Still, this only represents about 1% of those affected.  The problem is if they all get it soon and overwhelm the medical providers as 1% of 360 mil is still 3.6 million people.
1237938935281614848 2020-03-12 08:40:16 <Yretciva> Tim Killian, a spokesman for the nursing home, Life Care Center of Kirkland, said its medical staff had found the #coronavirus to be troubling, volatile and unpredictable, the @nytimes reported.  #Covid19 https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/coronavirus-update-us-victims-go-from-no-symptoms-to-death-in-hours-c-740885 …
1237938929245945857 2020-03-12 08:40:15 <Slacking_Off> The advice is if you’re in a high risk group, ie the elderly or have chronic medical issues, to stay home as much as possible and avoid crowds and mass gatherings.
1237938927211884544 2020-03-12 08:40:14 <DrNgoziOnuoha> Am sure corona🦠 is hampering medical tourism. This is why it is important to develop home grown healthcare.
1237938925722877952 2020-03-12 08:40:14 <ShayS426> I knew a celeb would get it soon. This shit is so for real.  The good news is that the Hanks are rich, so they will be able to afford & will get the best medical care that is available.  I wish that could be said for everyone who will get it. #CoronavirusPandemic #WashYourHands

1237938911717949441 2020-03-12 08:40:11 <ThomasJReynold4> Of course, we need to send unlimited billions to Israel.  How else will their government be able to afford all those free medical tests for their people?  Also, does this situation suggest who is really in control of the U.S?

Yes? Yes. Okay.
1237938905242054658 2020-03-12 08:40:09 <scotherrick> To get enough done to flatten the curve and not overwhelm the medical system, yes, we do need to temporarily upend life as we’ve known it. Going to be tough.

It's thanks to their financial aid I'm able to go to the Joslin Diabetes Center.  My blood sugar is doing much better, thanks to their help and the patient assistance meds I'm on.

1237938859154915334 2020-03-12 08:39:58 <pdxTimmay> A reminder that players are young and healthy, and risks for them are relatively low (not zero), but much of the rest of the NBA staff, like coaches, medical, and front office, are significantly older and are typically higher-risk.

1237938838594412546 2020-03-12 08:39:53 <JamesKenney3> What we need is the most aggressive testing regime ever seen.   All that money going to the payroll tax holiday,  give it to top notch medical clinics around the country.  The risk is not those who have symptoms,  it is those who have the virus and are asymptomatic.
1237938835239075840 2020-03-12 08:39:52 <mtnbvan> At community spread level yes. So allow more internationals travellers crossing borders, including infected & asymptomatic is imprudent if not foolish unless high level official, medical etc.  Yes agree testing is key. USA doesn't have it happening & Canada is slightly better

1237938822115135488 2020-03-12 08:39:49 <SeanRhoades89> No our healthcare system doesn't have a supply limit, our medical care/crisis care does have a limit. These are completely different.

He says Trump's pupils are regularly dilated to 8MM which in an adult is a medical emergency. Many reasons, in Trump's case, he concludes, drugs.  https://medium.com/@DrGJackBrown/body-language-and-medical-analysis-4221-why-are-donald-trumps-pupils-intermittently-so-large-f4d883c8126a …
1237938806386548736 2020-03-12 08:39:45 <BrianDStraw> Some countries have successfully slowed the spread. That is the goal of social distancing. You want to slow the spread to give the medical community a chance to keep up. If we do not slow the spread of the disease, hospitals will run out of beds.

1237938800212316160 2020-03-12 08:39:44 <biggiantfreak> Here are two facts:   1) about 40% of americans owe some form of medical debt to an insurance company or hospital.  2) insurance companies spent $52M on PAC donations in 2012.   These facts should be enough to convince anyone that private health insurance needs to be abolished
1237938794596372480 2020-03-12 08:39:43 <PineBarPrince> I've been following reports out of Italy for a few days and they are horrific. I was in tears reading how despondent the medical professionals are that they are unable to save people due to being overwhelmed & out of resources.  We need to flatten the curve before it's too late!

1237938784991244288 2020-03-12 08:39:40 <MidnightForces1> Yes, it’s America. Trump announced relief for all the medical bills, but you still will have to pay big bucks.

1237938770999046147 2020-03-12 08:39:37 <Cyclenut66> I’m not sneering, but you really don’t understand the nature of a medical consult. There is only so much that can be done remotely. At some stage hands need to laid on a patient, samples taken, lungs/heart listened too.

"1237938696340385792 2020-03-12 08:39:19 <JoshBoeke> Never really shared them publicly but suspected a lot of it was panic induced by cognitive bias (certainly a lot of it is, to be fair). I can see now why this is much more serious than ""just a bad flu"" - the overtaxing of the medical system especially has major repercussions."

1237938595303960579 2020-03-12 08:38:55 <Artemesia44> Fantasy land.  Ordinary Americans don't get the concierge medical care Congressmen do.  They wait in lines, get groped at airports, have their insurance claims denied and don't get tested when they need it for Corona.  Matt Gaetz and Dr. Redfield don't have those issues.
1237938593479274497 2020-03-12 08:38:55 <PolskaKing1> You're missing the proportionality of it all. So 327.2 mil÷2 = 163.6mil 163.6mil x 3.5% (mortality rate) = 5.7 mil deaths.   The WHO is probably calculating a reduced mort rate for our higher level of medical care

1237938536290177025 2020-03-12 08:38:41 <LondonTitan> What you have in the US is a patchwork, mix and match system at best rather than true, universal healthcare as seen elsewhere in every other western democracy.  A system that leaves over 10% of the population without any healthcare is a liability in times of medical crisis.

1237938527633051649 2020-03-12 08:38:39 <Night_Market> Please do.  There's nothing like threats of denying medical supplies to people that are sick from a plague that you yourself unleashed, hid and still continue to lie about, that is more guaranteed to cause hatred and a demand for vengeance.
1237938527301701632 2020-03-12 08:38:39 <SpicyPurritos> You’re making a lot of assumptions. Why? The article even contradicts what you’re saying, as does the medical board. CDC GLs are not law FYI.

1237938198334103552 2020-03-12 08:37:20 <homotologist> In the last couple of hours.  Tom Hanks and wife test positive for coronavirus. Top Italian medical officer dies from coronavirus.  US experts project 70-150 million people to contract coronavirus.  US government suspends all travel to and from Europe except UK.   #Pandumbic

When we have to deal with soaring medical bills during an epidemic. Now you liberals see how easily your privilege can be taken away, buckle in."
1237938186908663808 2020-03-12 08:37:18 <praise_sanders> Quite an ignorant statement Mr. Johnson! Bernie has addressed the issues with insulin and other forms of medicine multiple times. Marijuana is being used to treat all sorts of medical issues, including Lou Gehrig's Disease (A member of my church has this).
1237938176691507200 2020-03-12 08:37:15 <uurrrraaaa> If it were up to Democrats, the vast majority of our economic, medical and pharmaceutical infrastructure would be dependent on Communist China who’s national debt ran up to 300% its gdp prior 2016, and who’s industrial complex is now at a near standstill.
1237938176641155072 2020-03-12 08:37:15 <secretfakename> The thing is without proper modern medical care the 120,000 people that have gotten coronavirus would have had a higher mortality rate.  There’s 70,000 respirators in the US right now.   If just 1,000,000 Americans get sick at once which will be afforded the opportunity to live?
1237938172555751424 2020-03-12 08:37:14 <diddlywack> Again I don’t want to downplay how this affects the elderly, the sick, or babies- we need to be good global citizens but seriously? All the hype this is getting is a little ridiculous. If there’s something I’m missing can someone in the medical field pls explain it to me??

1237938166725619716 2020-03-12 08:37:13 <Andrew_Bed> How many people aren't going to get tested because of the cost? Or not go to a doctor because they can't afford the co-pay? Could be a lot of medical bankruptcies in our future and I doubt those in charge are going to do something about it.
"1237938163911462915 2020-03-12 08:37:12 <robertdobbs> Thank you! That is what I was getting at. I just don't want people to think that they can fly to OZ and expect ""Free Health Care"" without all the visas and work permits. On holiday you might be on the hook for medical bills and travel insurance is recommended.  Cuba is Free. 😉"

1237938140448358400 2020-03-12 08:37:07 <komiliton> While I agree with your sentiment in general I'd like to point out that 'scientific attention' is contingent on funding. This seems to be a major problem around the world, Australia included. Expert and science bashing is on the rise, not just in medical area.

1237938100086734848 2020-03-12 08:36:57 <EllenDibble> Panic? At my age, waiting to be left to die is not a new concept.

1237938087788978182 2020-03-12 08:36:54 <ASADPHS> Italy has 10,500 active cases. 80% require no hospitalization. That leaves 2100 who need hospital beds. Italy has a population of 61 million. NYC has a population of 8 million and has 26,000 hospital beds. So why all the stress on their medical system? Why a CFR 8x > S Korea?
1237938077684731905 2020-03-12 08:36:52 <Joonuper> That’s correct, I’m from WA, and we blue states fared better. I’m talking about WA here because the medical center he mentions is here in WA.
1237938076653150208 2020-03-12 08:36:51 <mtnbvan> We agree upon the testing & medical side. Disagree re: mobility & freedom for leisure travel at this point. Serious restrictions needed in Canada & USA temporarily. Americans infecting Cdns & vice versa & other countries. But test kits not prolific. BC has tested more than USA

He was 34 and had no known medical conditions.  There are many others.  Not everyone that dies is old or sick.  Yes, most are, but not all.

1237938058445479942 2020-03-12 08:36:47 <evilgrrl> Yes, as well as not enough hospital beds, ICUs or medical personnel. Probably not enough hospitals.   I foresee financial crisis as well.   The virus has been circulating in the us for at least 2-3 weeks.

1237937913880436736 2020-03-12 08:36:13 <yennikwok> In an article published in the medical journal Lancet, a group of health researchers argued that the coronavirus has “defied conventional containment strategy” because patients at the early stages of infection may have no or only vague symptoms while being infectious.  https://twitter.com/hkumed/status/1237707550981632000 …

1237937897044619264 2020-03-12 08:36:09 <DevotedBrownie> Yep. People need to relax. Wash your hands, sanitize and take proper medical precaution if need be. You’ll be fine.

1237937845299490816 2020-03-12 08:35:56 <JustinKatzRI> Guess we end where we began. Medical prof'ls & epidemiologists rightly have a narrow focus. People w/a narrow focus should almost never make decisions for entire societies. They'll tend to underestimate other considerations & lower the threshold at which they should dominate.
1237937837493735425 2020-03-12 08:35:54 <kapilartha> Tell NRI to use the foreign medical facilities of nations. Why so difficult? They live there, what do they want to return? Its other case to pick up indian tourists or students who have gone there for limited time.
1237937827758796801 2020-03-12 08:35:52 <denise_rutan> So if you have no symptoms that still means The List is excuse enough to put people on national security risk lists -- to put disenfranchisement routines in play, how politically, genocidally opportunistic & convenient.

1237937805650808832 2020-03-12 08:35:47 <def_not_emmi> the current process for one specific detention center is to fill out a request form medical help. the one doctor for 500~ women shows up after about a week. if it’s determined they’re (still) sick, they would need to purchase medication through commissary - typically only Motrin

1237937802521780224 2020-03-12 08:35:46 <audhilly> Are you paying attention to this virus?? It's going to disable the country's medical system. In Italy, they don't have enough ICU beds for the people who need them.  I'm out until Mar 25. CUNY is out until May.
1237937801947045889 2020-03-12 08:35:46 <UzairSaiyed1> @WHO said #Covid_19 is preventable with the support of common people, political leadership, government, and medical body's. It is #doable.

1237937787963191296 2020-03-12 08:35:43 <PerfectlyFriedB> Limiting growth is a medical system measure. If we don't keep R0 low enough we'll completely swamp our docs and ICUs. Once that happens are docs are going to have to make wartime like triage decisions just like they are in Italy now.  EU ban makes little sense. Gatherings lots.
1237937787447508992 2020-03-12 08:35:42 <kone65542941> You have a good point. You should advise the Italian government to buy medical equipment from other countries. Such as EU partners. As a matter of fact, Chinese medical supplies is also in short supply.

1237937768338087936 2020-03-12 08:35:38 <Oldschoolparent> What I am wondering about is how the best country in the world, with the best medical system, the best politicians, the best economy, the best education system... Can even have a single case of #COVID19. America is so great, it simply can't be happening. Must be a #fakevirus

1237937760679473152 2020-03-12 08:35:36 <TEK_2014> I understand the hysteria that’s ensuing around COVID-19 & I get that certain demographics are at a much higher risk (i.e. elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, etc.). It’s about our medical infrastructure and our capacity to provide treatment to all in need.

1237937749589712896 2020-03-12 08:35:33 <RuthAdamsRN10> My point is that the risk is harder to control, we carry medical waste in our personal vehicles ect I have not seen a mask, sinks in patients homes are often a hazard. Most nurse I know working in hospitals have access to much better PPE
1237937742530490368 2020-03-12 08:35:32 <nordickjay> I sure wish we'd have shut down flights from China and Iran and Japan at the end of January in an attempt to flatten the curve and allow Canadian medical staff to prepare for the possibility of what's now occurring.

1237937721773096962 2020-03-12 08:35:27 <shutupliverurok> this bs right here is why I’ve just stayed home sick 10 days now. I’m already sick, not, so far, sick enough to go to ER, but sick enough not to waste my time going out looking for medical intervention. I’m too tired to just sit in a waiting room, possibly getting others sick.
1237937721554939904 2020-03-12 08:35:27 <wealthy_donor> yeah i went to the store and everybody had bought all the sanitizing stuff/food so i just bought a shit load of vodka and i’m drunk watching akira for the next oh six weeks.  fuck it all tbh

1237937708489678848 2020-03-12 08:35:24 <FrankSowa1> 4/ In Italy, Emergency triage has been set up to make decision on who gets a hospital bed & who gets placed in 30day mandatory isolation lockdown w/o direct medical aid. Remember, all patients have life-threatening conditions. These are war actions. Will we be doing that in USA?
1237937707977977856 2020-03-12 08:35:24 <Ericust9> In what world would that be possible lmao. They have a full medical staff at their job...
1237937707801882624 2020-03-12 08:35:23 <iStayWinning365> Not having fans attend the games then yeah. But at this point I don’t think stopping the games makes sense especially in the NHL. I see your handle says “Dr”. I don’t know if you’re a medical doctor but at this point how long do you think the NBA would need to suspend the season
1237937704098091009 2020-03-12 08:35:23 <ideasandfood> We don’t have enough ICU beds.  We don’t have enough ventilators. We don’t have enough medical pros.   And unlike Italy, we have an enormous population that can’t afford to seek medical help or are afraid to.  We are worst case scenario with a death toll in the millions.

It seems the Cheeto gave false information and insurers are not necessarily covering it all. So “no surprise medical bills” was a lie.
1237937388481130502 2020-03-12 08:34:07 <mmfu> I'm all for you guys passing a bill for an emergency but not putting your stupid pork in it to make it fatter than what it is you should do one from a medical emergency then do 1 with nothing but pork

You should provide test kits to the public and more medical centers with testing capabilities.

1237937261691285505 2020-03-12 08:33:37 <searchfeast> My point related to doctors mocking/sneering at ppl wanting their own docs 2 b tested if they have cold symptoms BEFORE seeing patients.  People do not appreciate being sneered at 4 wanting medical caution while docs themselves screen potentially hazardous clients. Hence my pt.

It takes some time for the symptoms to show themselves.  Meanwhile, the medical system would be ramping up.

1237937126655868928 2020-03-12 08:33:05 <s3k21y76> Correct, BUT we have the medical means for the flu, we do not for this- not yet.
1237937124747300864 2020-03-12 08:33:04 <BrendonCassidy> Oh, and he also lied about about almost every single thing he said in the speech. Trade and cargo will not be banned. And medical treatment will not be covered at all. Only the $30-$50 copay. Kind of a big omission.
1237937120033026050 2020-03-12 08:33:03 <ArtAshta> There will be very little medical assistance once a person gets COVID-19 and needs a hospital bed. Governments should be building large open plan hospitals NOW before it's too late - otherwise they will be sending people away from hospitals - to die

1237937116497080320 2020-03-12 08:33:02 <Haydenparker_> American Medical Association studied the records of 72,314 people, 44,672 were confirmed as having COVID-19. Of those, 36,160, 81%, showed mild symptoms, 14% severe 5% critical. The death rate was 2.3%, 1,023 out of 44,672. The flu is more contagious and kills 61,000 annually.

1237937110092517377 2020-03-12 08:33:01 <AlexanderMcCoy4> This is why really the only serious answer is “a progressive VP pick.” i.e. literally give us a different person.  Not a small chance he’ll die in office or step down for medical reasons, so that would be a meaningful gesture.
1237937108125241344 2020-03-12 08:33:00 <Doriann200> Trump wasted time that could have been used to prepare for dealing with the virus including more testing, setting up field hospitals, increasing the # of medical personnel. He is a disgrace.

1237937102970593280 2020-03-12 08:32:59 <ceilidh_2855> Decisive action would include plans to bolster and support our medical systems and personnel and to distribute and use test kits - for a start.
1237937096654041089 2020-03-12 08:32:58 <CarlLND> I’m telling y’all: if the NBA, MLB, NCAA, NASCAR, festival and music industry, movie industry all cease, do you realize how many trillions of dollars will be lost? And if the disease keeps spreading, do you realize how much money will be needed to help us get the medical help?
1237937095785807872 2020-03-12 08:32:58 <Jon47963440> Even with tests, people dont always go to the dr. This virus doesn't affect everyone to the point that they run to the ER. Again,  just like the flu; not everyone seeks medical treatment

1237936777467314177 2020-03-12 08:31:42 <MelGabrielleEnt> Hey Trump. Adar Here. We know what you are doing. This is a set-up for the New World Order and Medical Martial Law. Just so you know, your plans are all over the Internet. 😌The Bride and Manchild leave soon. You know who we are. Your plans will be stopped and the truth revealed
1237936774472773632 2020-03-12 08:31:41 <VacantStare71> Your stupid tax cut will do NOTHING POSITIVE. So just stop it already. Instead of trying to further wreck the economy, how about you let the doctors talk about the medical stuff and actually act Presidential?

1237936719334387712 2020-03-12 08:31:28 <JoshuaChaffee> This is a sobering read about how an outbreak overwhelms a country's medical capacity, as is happening in Italy.

1237936686295703552 2020-03-12 08:31:20 <TheSpiceEffect> That means that a Covid influx will result in strained care for people with ALL medical conditions as facilities and staffs reach breaking points. That says nothing of the real nightmare scenario, if healthcare providers THEMSELVES become ill in real numbers 2/

1237936656046530563 2020-03-12 08:31:13 <JayeEryk> The world's getting a small taste of what life must've been like during other plagues. Imagine something like this, but w/out the medical advancements of today. Truth: The poor / lower middle class & those w/out insurance could have mortality rates as if it were 100's of yrs ago.
1237936649545363456 2020-03-12 08:31:11 <Deve_Dy> (Also a good argument that the government should be able to coordinate the production of vital goods during a crisis! It's pretty fucked that we're already experiencing widespread shortages of fairly basic medical goods and the state can't quickly respond!)

Also sending employees home and encouraging them to see a doctor if they don't feel well. Nothing about paid sick leave or medical care. #COVID2019
1237936601503657984 2020-03-12 08:31:00 <drbruceashford> Pretty good. The experts have been engaged early and for the most part, here and in the US, not too many mistakes obvious. They seem willing to spend to help and energised to enhance capability for scientific and medical response.

1237936591739502593 2020-03-12 08:30:57 <redwinereddog> Honestly I’ve seen it go both ways and I think it’s completely up to the person. I know people making way more with a HS diploma than classmates who spent 6 years in college. But also we wouldn’t have anyone in the medical, legal, etc fields if people didn’t go to college.

1237936493215137792 2020-03-12 08:30:34 <bewpy88> It is only deadly to people who are old with underlying medical conditions. This is why Italy's fatality rate is so high. Italy has an aging population. It should be taken seriously, but that doesn't mean the fear mongering media shouldn't be called out for over hyping it.

1237936660412870656 2020-03-12 08:31:14 <KyrabeStories> As a kid, I ran full speed into a heavy rock covered industrial trash can at a water park because I was chasing my shadow. Successfully KOed myself in the process.  Bonus: I also managed to knock the trash can over WITH MY HEAD. I still have the scar beside my left eye.  https://twitter.com/NaomisLitPix/status/1237791804142964736 …

1237936643819974658 2020-03-12 08:31:10 <HOPEFUL213> Unfortunately, the person the Democrats backed is weak as water and not a fighter especially when faced w. republicans. He will swear at & arm wrestle old tom, but Trump, Moscow Mitch et al - he will simply tremble. Biden is weak as water....just saying. Warren would have mind  https://twitter.com/mmpadellan/status/1237924902411345920 …
1237936640716398594 2020-03-12 08:31:09 <sdmp0> That’s completely and factually incorrect. The only way a libel suit holds any water against a public figure is if the person knows for a fact that the statement is incorrect. Since Biden has not released a cognitive test proving his fitness, this is a legit criticism.

The latter is often a bit easier if it's clear/obvious that you will interact directly with the owner.

1237936415268196352 2020-03-12 08:30:15 <niftymitch> For various reasons good old soap and water works better than 140 proof hand sanitizer.  And is less expensive...  Out and about hand sanitizer ... yep.
1237936413754011648 2020-03-12 08:30:15 <hundredrabbits> Mostly okay, from up on deck as far as we can see. Below water is another story. We'll know once we get Pino out... once the trailer lift is fixed.
1237936413120688128 2020-03-12 08:30:15 <ranikalalala> Just some extra advice drink lemon water, it has so many antioxidants to fight viruses bc it’s high in vitamin C, reduces inflammation and cleanses your system daily. Your body is a natural fighter itself so just give it that extra boost everyday and book those flights 👀

1237936403775918080 2020-03-12 08:30:13 <smileyysides> no, bc imo its not really as bad as people are making it out to be unless the have underlying health issues, such as asthma, smoke, etc. but they say you just have to take ibuprofen, tylenol, drink lots of water, get lots of rest, stay home basically what you would do for a cold

Also you can rub them with coconut oil, which is also antibacterial & soothing. Just a couple natural ideas to try but only when she’s ready.

1237934589961789440 2020-03-12 08:23:00 <latchkeyforever> I have found the only thing that truly works to make a cough productive is oregano oil. Not the capsules, the oil. Taste awful. I take it in a little shot of water. iamazing for boosting immunity. Chestful of knives<<productive cough in hours.

If you do have to go out, stay at least 6ft away from others. Wash hands often, clean & sanitize surfaces/handles/switches, drink lots of water, eat well & sleep well for good immune system.

1237933919649087489 2020-03-12 08:20:20 <AintShytNUKnew> @heyalyshahey said that her mouth was so dry that when she drank the water so hard out the bottle it turned inside out 😭😭😭😭

1237933907326259200 2020-03-12 08:20:17 <DanielRMaxwell> keep your residence clean,  try to remain calm,  see your doctor if you are sick regardless of the actual cause of being sick,  and maintain a basic stock of emergency supplies such as dry foods, bottled water, and a first aid kit
1237933906503983104 2020-03-12 08:20:17 <bigbadave> Most can't even organise hot water in the toilets, but it's a great idea, along with defibrillators.
1237933905161805824 2020-03-12 08:20:17 <SamLMontano> Had a bit of time between meetings so I came down to the water.   Sitting on a beach during a pandemic is some real dystopian shit.  pic.twitter.com/qFeONOtNBD
1237933899994615809 2020-03-12 08:20:16 <vashiane> PSA: don’t ever get RainSoft water softeners they’re bullshit. We’ve had this problem for months.
1237933899721789442 2020-03-12 08:20:16 <Prettyyjennyy_> You can't be completely germ free so work on YOUR well being. Drink organic cranberry juice, take those vitamins & drink that water!

1237933883737305088 2020-03-12 08:20:12 <acevonjohnson> The Babadook or Get out. Or the conjuring. Or the VVitch. Or The Shape of Water (not reeeeeally horror but it’s basically the Creature/black Lagoon retold)   And yes. I prefer tube for studio but not live. Modeling is almost too immaculate to ignore now. Plus, dependability. 🤘🏻

1237933876640649218 2020-03-12 08:20:10 <PerhamSwimming> So with all this Coronavirus talk and all the sports canceling events, it is time to point out.. Swimmers basically live in bleach and swallow all that water, it is then logical that swimming is safest, healthiest sport in all the land.. Come and join the sport and save yourself!
1237933875617075200 2020-03-12 08:20:10 <GorskiOPork> They are punishing him & the dragons like he is guilty. & you can’t at all guarantee they’ve got anything that will even hold water. The severity of the accusation can’t come into it. There are always vexatious allegations. Think about what just happened to Josh Reynolds.

1237933851143479296 2020-03-12 08:20:04 <moody_water> Thank you. I’ve never had a relationship so I don’t have any real life experience but I know that if I already love a character it doesn’t matter to me if a fanfiction makes them genderfluid or trans, but that is most likely because it helps me feel understood and seen.
1237933850636017664 2020-03-12 08:20:04 <teaandquilla> Certain ones can shrink the balls but that’s like big time I need this shit like I need water users

1237933847964237824 2020-03-12 08:20:03 <flutterpolitely> Are you serious? Wow, that is crazy! Soap and water is the better method anyway. I’ve been in denial about the panic because I just saw it on the news, it didn’t affect my area but the news showed customers at the Costco near me today, buying up all the toilet paper. insanity!
1237933847817355264 2020-03-12 08:20:03 <DumbassCumSlut> Okay that was fun but I should really go to sleep now it's 3am aaaaa goodnight guys 💜 drink water and wash your hands and shit
1237933846898847744 2020-03-12 08:20:03 <LittleDipperP> *He sighed and his ears pointed down.* The thing is I've never studied the water in this waterfall. I still don't know all of its properties.

1237933826678099968 2020-03-12 08:19:58 <deekshay_> Don’t think the hot water thing is entirely true.
1237933824190959617 2020-03-12 08:19:58 <alwaystheself> Ask about: medication, food, water, household supplies and whether they can pay the bills. We're gonna have to share resources as a society, one way or another.

Gloves might help, but not a mask.

The greatest cavity fighting mechanism for fluoride is having it in drinking water while your teeth are forming   Topical applications are for developed teeth. If dentists were demonic they wouldn’t want patients to have access to fluoride. There’s no profit in fluoride

1237933735875506176 2020-03-12 08:19:36 <HerrickMartina> Hopefully all aspects of this are examined.  We don't need to create another imbalance in nature!!  Where do they get the hydrogen from? Is it derived from water? Cause much of the planet is suffering, or so it's reported, a water shortage. Though there's flooding predicted also.
1237933733824442368 2020-03-12 08:19:36 <drmanishranchi> Visibly at the idea of accepting a glass of water from a Muslim or lower caste household, more so if they are vegetarian, the Muslim might have had beef!

Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why?
1237932821827555329 2020-03-12 08:15:59 <RawbertMeltzer> The markets are gonna go crazy. Idk what he means by CME but this coronavirus isnt a joke. Get supplies while you can for your families sake even of they think your just overreacting go and get food and water. No processed shit. Stop eating sugar and buy the things i tweeted.
1237932820431024128 2020-03-12 08:15:58 <Kalezzz629> I have to say it’s a thrilling watching everybody struggle with covid-19.... it’s kinda like hunger games! Will our government start quarantining us without food or water and/or make us fight for supplies of hand sanitizer?

1237932807902629889 2020-03-12 08:15:55 <A_diva_lawyer> For my first time juicing, it wasn't that bad.  I had moments of hunger, but water provided fullness.  I have an over abundance of energy.    There are mixed reviews about its benefits.  I can only attest to an increase in energy.  Nonetheless, I feel awesome inside.

1237932772720807936 2020-03-12 08:15:47 <AlexSeerck> You'd be shocked knowing that water is not wet. Water can make you wet(no pun intended), but water is not wet by itself. Traps are gay, though.

1237932746569388033 2020-03-12 08:15:41 <AnonNonsense> The new EU travel ban by US defies logic unless the testing problem is so acute the POTUS needs to cut numbers any where he can.

1237932428250972160 2020-03-12 08:14:25 <TexasGus> I believe Trump also banned Chinese Checkers (wrong), Chinese Water Torture (might be OK), Chinese Zodiac (wrong and hurtful).  Waiting for exact language from Executive Order.

We are both water signs so I guess that’s why but still, seeing some of your stuff has actually helped me get through similar things in my own life and I want to thank you for that. 💗

1237932418998378496 2020-03-12 08:14:23 <SashaHemon> In the light of new developments, my good America spouse bought supplies of duck tape, water purifying pills, and solar-powered flash lights. Thus she’s become Bosnian-a person organizing life around expectations of catastrophe.

1237932403357671424 2020-03-12 08:14:19 <Cr3wBoss> Thimerosal: Yes, this contains mercury. However, it is a compound of mercury. This is present in some fish and some foods. This prevents contamination of the vaccine.  Aluminum salts: You ingest these when you are drinking tap water, and some bottled waters, and health products.
